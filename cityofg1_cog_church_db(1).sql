He does not have a good plan for man. \"The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. John 10 vs. 10\r\n\r\nThe sickness of Lazarus was not from God, but from Satan. It was an evil plan of Lazarus\'s enemy to send him to the grave. The enemy actually succeeded in sending him to an early grave without much delay, and got him buried before the arrival of Christ.\r\n\r\nThe only plan of the enemy for the people of God is to steal, kill, and destroy them.\r\n\r\n\"Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick, John 11 vs. 3\r\n\r\nLazarus was a good friend of Jesus whom He loved so much. Immediately he fell sick, they sent a message to Jesus that his friend Lazarus was terribly sick. In such a situation, what would you expect from Jesus that loved Lazarus dearly? Of course, you would expect Jesus to run quickly to the place the power of God upon Him to heal His friend. \"When Jesus heard that, he said, this sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby. Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. John 11 vs. 4-5.\r\n\r\nThe response of Jesus to the people they sent to Him was encouraging enough, but He did not turn up until Lazarus died. Shall we say Jesus was being wicked? No, He was not. Neither Jesus nor God does wicked things. \"For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. Jeremiah 29 vs. 11. The Bible says the thoughts of God towards man are thoughts of peace, joy, blessings and good motives. But then, Lazarus was sick to the level of death and Jesus did not go there .Why? \"For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so aremy ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. Isaiah 55vs.8- 9.\r\n\r\nOne thing that is not clear to us is that, God does not operate the way man operates. We always expect God to operate the way we plan. Don\'t forget that God is our creator, who exclusively holds the master plan of our lives.\r\n\r\nThere was a time I was planning to travel abroad, to the U.S precisely. I fasted and offered serious prayers. Instead of asking God if it was His will for me to travel abroad or not, I was bent on making God to do my own will. In the end, the travel plan did not work out and I concluded that God did not love me.\r\n\r\n\"But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 5 vs. 8\r\nDon\'t forget that God sent His only begottenSon that did not commit any sin to die for the sins of mankind in the name of love. Just because my travel plan did not materialize, I concluded that God did not love me. The truth of the matter is that, whoever that prays according to the will of God will definitely not be put to shame.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou had a particular problem and you called upon God to save you and He did not; you now. concluded in your mind that God did not love you. I want to tell you it is absolutely not correct. God loves you.\r\n\r\nThere was a time a king told one of his servants that God did not create him well, because one of his fingers was completely off. The servant replied and said, \"Your highness, God created you very well and perfect.\" The king was very angry at the servant\'s responseand ordered his security men to put him in prison immediately. Meanwhile, the king was also a hunter and usually went to the bush to hunt for animals, with the servant that he put in prison. On that fateful day, the king was the only one that went to the bush for hunting. On getting there, a group of people scouting for whom to sacrifice to their god saw the king in the bush and captured him. They took the king to their shrine and as they were about to use him for the sacrifice, one of them discovered that his fingers were not complete. He was immediately rejected and allowed to go.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn getting to his palace, he ordered the security men to release the servant in the prison. When the servant came out of the prison, the king narrated to him what he went through in the bush that day; that he was almost used for sacrifice, if not for theincompleteness of his fingers that saved him. And the servant also said, \"My Lord, it was God\'s love upon me that made you to put me in prison, otherwise, I would have rather been used for the sacrifice because of my own complete fingers, if I had gone with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"He hath made everything beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.Eccl. 3 vs. 11.God is ever good and faithful in all situations. Don\'t ever say that God does not love you. He loves you more the way you love\r\n\r\n\"Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it\". 1 Thes. 5 vs. 24\r\n\r\nAre you saying Jesus didn\'t love Lazarus? He loved him in time of sickness, even morethan He loved him while he was not sick.\r\n\r\n\"But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold, Job 23 vs. 10\r\n\r\nDespite the travails Job went through; yet he did not say anything bad to God. He kept on waiting for God and confessed good things about himself. Just imagine someone whose body had been damaged and advised by his wife and friends to curse God, in order to be free from his predicaments and yet he did not do that. His wife and friends deserted him, but he held on unto God. In the end, he sang a song of victory to God. I always tell people that the delay of a miracle will only make the expected miracle to multiply.\r\n\r\nIf you are facing a situation that is not pleasant, never allow anyone to make you sayanything against your creator. Keep on praying to God; He will answer you one day. God loves you even more than the way you love yourself. Imagine what the Israelites went through in the wilderness; But God said He used all that to test and train them.\r\n\r\nDeut. 8 vs. 2-6 \"And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no. And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live. Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee,neither did thy foot swell, these forty years. Thou shalt also consider in thine that, as a man chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee. Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a time in the wilderness that they had no water to drink for three days; enemies stood against them, and just many unpleasant things happened to them. At the end of it all, God still showed His loving- kindness towards them.\r\n\r\nMy friend, can you now see that God is highly interested in that case you are facing right now? I pray that God will take glory over your case in Jesus name. Amen. God loves you more than anybody on earth. Your best prayer point over every unpleasant situation is that, God should take glory and let His will come to pass over your situation. I know at the end of everything, you will smile to the glory of God. \r\n\r\n', '\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFORTD OF MAN\r\n\r\nNo matter what man do in order to make things happen for their own good, there\'s always a limit to how far they can try, because man is limited in nature.\r\n\r\nThe sisters of Lazarus had tried their best to make their brother recover from his sickness. All their efforts were to no avail. Subsequently, they sent for Jesus who did not come on time. \"Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha. (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.) Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. \"John 11 VS. 1-3\r\n\r\nThey wanted their brother to get healed from that sickness and they did all that was humanly possible, but it yielded no result. Their last hope was to invite God; telling Him that the case at hand was beyond the ability of man, and believing the fact that there is nothing God cannot do. \"Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there anything too hard for me? Jeremiah 32 vs. 27. Instead of Jesus to go there immediately, He did not turn up on time to rescue the dying man. \"But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, withmen this is impossible; but with God all things are possible. Mathew 19 vs. 26\r\n\r\nThere was a time we prayed for one pregnant woman whose pregnancy was between five to six months. She went for a scan and the result revealed it was only fluid that was in her womb! Doctor advised her to flush it away. But thank God for the sister and her husband, who came to tell me the report of the doctor. I told them to allow the pregnancy to get to the ninth month and then we would know the next thing to do.\r\n\r\nWe kept on praying and the scan kept giving us wrong reports. But to God be the glory, after the ninth month of pregnancy, she delivered two baby boys! Frankly speaking as at that time, as a man, I was just praying to God to see what would end both the ninth month and my prayer to God.\r\n\r\nLet\'s also look at the case of Abraham andSarah. They had tried all they could do, but then they could not manufacture a baby. It was so disappointing to the extent that Sarah told Abraham, her husband to sleep with their maid in order to help God achieve their goal; since that is all man can do in a situation like that.\r\n\r\nWhen God told them that the following year they would embrace a baby, Sarah did not believe it considering her old age. \"And they said unto him, where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him. Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? Genesis 18 vs. 9-12..\r\n\r\nYou would have done many things in order to overcome that predicament, yet the problem still persists; I pray you will rejoice over it in Jesus name.\r\n\r\nMan can only do the possibilities while God will do the impossibilities. When sisters of Lazarus had tried their best and nothing positive happened they sent for Jesus, who can do all things.\r\n\r\nI am also very sure that the family of the woman with the issue of blood would have tried all efforts, to stop the blood from flowing from her body for good twelve years. But they could not and she ultimately transferred the case to Jesus. \"And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched thehem of his garment: Mathew 9 vs. 20\r\n\r\nFriend, let me tell you one thing; if anyone is telling you he will help you to overcome your problem, don\'t believe it. It is better you have faith in God that can do all things.\r\n\r\nThe woman with the issue of blood took her case to Jesus and she was made whole. Don\'t forget as I said earlier that man is limited in nature, but God is unlimited. Man would only try to the best of their capabilities, but they can\'t achieve the best except God who can do all things.\r\n\r\nI pray that any impossibility in your life shall be possible in Jesus name. Whatever you may be passing through, don\'t point an accusing finger at God as the cause, but rather praise Him for a miracle over the problem. May the special grace to wait on God come\r\n', '\r\nPOWER OF THE GRAVE\r\n\r\nWhat is a grave?\r\n\r\ngrave can be regarded as an excavation in the ground as a place of burial. It can also be any place of interment, tomb or sepulchre. It is a place where the dead; both the righteous and unrighteous are being buried. \"And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died. Genesis 5 vs. 5. Even Adam, with the years he spent on earth\r\n\r\n31was not exempted from the assignment of the grave.\r\n\r\nSin brought about death, which opened the door for the grave. When man sinned in the Garden of Eden, there was a death penalty issued by God to them. \"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. Genesis 3 vs. 19\r\n\r\nThe verse says man came from the dust and will return to the dust. From that day, if a man dies, the body is deposited in the grave. It was the plan of the enemy for a man to die and be buried in the grave. It was not God\'s plan.\r\n\r\n\"For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected endjeremiah 29 vs. 11.\r\n\r\nThe plan of God for man was to be like Him, but Satan came and changed the plan through sin. Don\'t forget that God hates sin. Immediately sin came in, the glory, peace, joy, longevity etc. departed from man. Satan does not have a good plan for man than to kill and destroy.\"The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. John 10 vs. 10.Satan usually employs the means of making man to sin in order to kill and destroy their God-given potentials.\r\n\r\nNo matter how powerful you may be on earth, once you are dead and buried, there is nothing you can do again in the grave. No glory or potential can operate in the grave. Even as powerful as prophet Elisha was in his time, immediately he died, everything went down with him to the grave. I call the grave a glory or potential \'silencer\'. I pray for you that the enemy will not send your glory to the grave in Jesus name.\r\n\r\nSince the grave has been swallowing the body of man, they have no power to deliver themselves from it. If Satan attacks you with a sickness, never think that is the end of his operations over your life. All his plan is to lead you to the grave, which is the end of his operations over man. Many unstirred potentials have been buried in the grave. A man of God once said that, the most beautiful place on earth is the grave. We asked him why. And he said the grave is where unrealized potentials are buried. Every plan of the devil to bury your potential will not work in Jesusname. Amen.\r\n\r\nWhen Lazarus was sick, he eventually died and was buried. The grave swallowed his body before the arrival of Christ. \"Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already... John 11 vs. 17\r\n\r\nEven when our Lord Jesus died, the grave also received His body. \"And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed. Mathew 27 vs. 59- 60. There is no one that the grave cannot swallow, but power surpasses power. The grave has the power to swallow and silence man forever; but there is another power that supersedes the power of the grave. The next chapter will give you more details about this.Power had been taken away from the grave since the power of resurrection had manifested through Christ Jesus. Whatever the enemy might have done to you, the power of resurrection will deliver you in Jesus name. Amen.\r\n\r\n\r\n', '\r\nPOWER OF RESURRECTION\r\n\r\nThe plan of the enemy was to end man\'s race in the grave, but our God is a great God that is greater than the greatest. He turned both the plan and the power of darkness upside down. Glory be to the name of God in the highest.\r\n\r\nWhat is resurrection? It\'s an act of rising from the dead and becoming alive again.\"And when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him. And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulcher at the rising of the sun. And they said among themselves, who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulcher? And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great. And entering into the sepulcher, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted. And he saith unto them, be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him\" Mark 16 vs. 1-6.\r\n\r\nIt was a surprise to the Disciples of Christ andeven the mother of Jesus, that how can a person be buried and on getting there the third day, they could not find His body in the grave? But the angel of God who sat close to the place informed them that Jesus had risen from the grave. He is no more a dead person but a living soul. It has never happened in the history of man.\r\n\r\n\"Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: John 11 vs. 25 Before the death of Jesus, He had already told Martha that he was the resurrection and the life. This means that the power of death and life is in the hands of Jesus.\r\n\r\nWhen Mary and Martha told Jesus that Lazarus was dead, He told them that Lazarus did not die; but would live, because He (Jesus) was the resurrection and life. The messagewas too hard for them to believe. And Jesus went straight to the place where Lazarus was buried. \"And he said, where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see\". John 11 vs. 34. When Jesus got to the tomb of Lazarus, He made the whole people to understand that He was the resurrection and life, who had the power over death and life. \"Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days. Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it,that they may believe that thou hast sent me. And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.\r\nAnd he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go\". John 11 vs. 39-44.\r\nLazarus who had been buried for four days and was now stinking was raised by Jesus.\r\nOn getting there, He used the power of resurrection and life to make the dead man live again. Jesus called out the dead Lazarus; and immediately the man that was dead came out alive. I pray that every dead thing in your life will receive divine touch of God in Jesus name. The greatest testimony of it was that Lazarus ate with Jesus. \"There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazaruswas one of them that sat at the table with him. John 12 vs. 1-2\r\nLazarus that was dead before came to life and began to eat with Jesus. The impossibility of man became possible through the power of resurrection. The enemy thought they had succeeded over Lazarus, but God that had the key of death and life brought Lazarus back to life and put his enemies to shame. Your enemy shall be put to shame in Jesus name. Amen.\r\nIt was the same power that was in the bones of Prophet Elisha. \"And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back: And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee, 1 Kings 13 VS. 20-21. Just consider someone that had died, not for one week or month, and the flesh had rotten completely and parted from the bones. What remained of him were only his bones and another dead person was buried in the same sepulchre. The dead body of that man touched the bones of Prophet Elisha and the man came back to life! A man can die, but the power of God that settles in his body cannot die. The bones of Elisha carried the power of resurrection. \"Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: John 11 vs. 25.\r\n\r\nWhoever that is in Christ is no more an ordinary person but a supernatural being. The moment you give your life to Jesus, everything about you becomes supernatural. \"Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new\".11 Corinthians 5 vs. 17. The old nature of man has passed away and new things in Christ begin to take place in you.\r\n\r\nJesus used the same resurrection power to bring forth the daughter of one ruler to life.\r\n\r\n\"He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn. But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose. And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land\". Mathew 9 vs. 24-26. People could not believe it. How could a girl that was dead come back to life? The power of God was there to bring her back to life. The word of God says that nothing is too hard for God. \"Behold, I am the Lord, the Godof all flesh: is there anything too hard for me?\"Jeremiah 32 vs.27\r\n\r\nThe grave is the end of satanic operations over a man\'s life, but for God, it\'s not over. There is nothing impossible for God to do. \"But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, with men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible. Matthew 19 vs. 26.\r\n\r\nWhat was that thing that doctor told you and said there was no solution to it? Bring the case to Jesus that can do all things. He is the resurrection and life. No one comes to Him and leaves the same. I can assure you that you will never be put to shame. Shame is not for the children of God but for Satan and his agents.\r\n\r\nWhat of the case of Dorcas? When she died; her case was taken to God throughApostle Peter and she came back to life. \"Now\r\n\r\nthere was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did. And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber.\r\n\r\nAnd forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them. Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them. But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And sheopened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up. Acts 9 vs. 36-40.\r\n\r\nThis power can only work in the lives of that surrender their lives to Jesus.\r\n\r\nFriend, what are you waiting for? This is an opportunity for you to know Jesus, accept Him today as your Lord and saviour. \"But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: John 1 vs. 12. If you accept Jesus today, you will be clothed with the power of God. Untimely death will not have power over you any longer; because the power has been taken away from death.\r\n\r\n\"So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where isthy sting? O grave, where is thy victory\"?\r\n\r\n1 Cor 15 vs. 54-55\r\n\r\nDeath has no power over the children of God. All power in heaven and on earth has been given to Jesus. This means that no more power in any other place. Glory be to God! \"And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Mathew 28 vs. 18.\r\n\r\nTell whoever that is using the power of death to terrorize you, that the power has been taken away from death. Christ had completed the assignment on the cross of Calvary. He said, \"It is finished\". \"When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up\r\n\r\nthe ghost. John 19 vs. 30\r\n\r\nAfter that, He went to the grave to perfect the work on the cross of the Calvary.\r\nSince then, no one can question the authority of Jesus. \"Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; Philippians 2 vs. 9-10.\r\n\r\nGod has highly exalted Him above all things on earth and in heaven. What is death when Jesus is operating? Who said you will not see tomorrow? Tell that person that death has been swallowed in victory and has no right to do you anything, anymore. Christ has fought the fight of victory on your behalf on the cross of Calvary. Halleluyah! Wake up and celebrate your Jesus. It\'s not yet time for you to die. No man or spirit can kill you because Jesus is on your side. Lazarus came to life; so everything that had died in your life will receive life inJesus name. Amen.\r\n\r\nYou will not die but live to show forth the glory of God on earth in Jesus name. Anyone that wishes you dead, tell that person or spirit that you have not finished your assignment on earth, and as a result of that, you cannot die. You will not die for your enemy to rejoice in Jesus name. Amen.\r\n', '\r\nLIFE IN THE GRAVE\r\n\r\nNo man can ever believe that there is life in the grave again. When the dead body has been buried and covered up with sand; some will even concrete over the burial ground. Somebody will now come and say there is still life in that dead body. That was the exact message that Jesus told Mary and Martha about Lazarus. The two women could not believe the message. \"Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus wascoming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house. Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee. Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. John 11 vs. 20-24 Jesus told Martha that her brother would still come back to life. Martha thought that Lazarus would rise again at the resurrection of the righteous. But Jesus told the woman that He was the resurrection and life. When Jesus met Mary, He told her what he told Martha. No one could believe that statement from Jesus, until when He went to the tomb of Lazarus and brought him back to life.\r\n\r\nJust as God told Abraham that his wifeSarah would have an issue at the age of seventy five. \"And they said unto him, where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him. Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?\r\n\r\nAnd the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old? Is anything too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son. \"Genesis 18 vs.9-14When Sarah heard the message, she laughed to the extent that the heavenly visitorsheard the laughter and said, \"Is there anything too hard for God\"?\r\n\r\nSome people could have even imagined and asked that; a person of that age, how was she going to cope with pregnancy? Are we talking about the stress or power to carry pregnancy? But one should not be surprised anyway, as that is the thought of the natural man. Our God is a supernatural being that can do all things. It was unbelievable that Sarah could have a child at that age, but God made it possible for her and Abraham.\r\n\r\n\"And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken. For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. AndAbraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac. \"Genesis 21 vs. 1-3\r\n\r\nGod made the impossible to be possible in the life of Sarah. What a great God! It was when Jesus went to the tomb of Lazarus and \'woke him up\' before the two women could believe Him.\r\n\r\nI don\'t know what you are facing at the moment as a person. May be you have even lost hope on that issue; don\'t lose hope; present the case before God and He will give you the solution.\r\n\r\nThere was a time a pregnant woman in our church was due to deliver a baby. A doctor told her she had a heart problem and she would not be able to deliver the baby. She came to the church and told me. And I told her, that was adoctor\'s report. We prayed to God to intervene in the case. The doctor had already told her not to attempt going into labour. But to God be the glory, she went into labour and between five to ten minutes, she delivered the baby! After the delivery, she went for another medical check- up and this time, the doctor told her she had no heart problem again.\r\n\r\nWhat of the case of the fifty- two years old woman in our church, who had never experienced pregnancy before? At fifty-two years of age, God answered her prayer. She conceived and had a baby girl. Her relations found it difficult to believe her report, but God did it for her all the same.\r\n\r\nYour business was doing well before and through it you were able to buy a car and build a house. But suddenly the business becamedistressed that you are now owing a debt and contemplating closing down the business. Don\'t close down the business, there is still life in it. Take the case to God in prayer and I can assure you that life will come out of the dead business. May be your own is incurable or resistant sickness, and doctor is fed up of your case and you are already hoping the sickness will take your life. Why not take the case to Jesus that has the power of resurrection and life? He is able to take away the sickness out of your life. Come to Jesus, the author and the finisher of our faith.\r\n\r\nThe woman with the issue of blood took her case to Jesus and she was completely healed. \"And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment: For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole. But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour Matthew 9 vs. 20-22.The woman had great faith in Jesus. She took the bold step of touching the garment of Jesus and she was instantly made whole. It is not until you see Jesus face to face before you can receive your miracle.\r\n\r\nWhat you need to do is to give your life to Jesus, by accepting Him as your Lord and saviour. \"For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoeve believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3 vs. 16. Whoever that acknowledges the love of God will enjoy the benefits of God. \"But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Romans 10 vs. 8-9.\r\n\r\nAccept Jesus wholeheartedly and confess Him with your mouth that He\'s the Lord. \"But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: John 1 vs. 12. Once you have given your life to Jesus, the power of God will come upon you immediately. You need Jesus to enjoy the blessings of God.\r\n\r\nFAITH\r\n\r\nFaith is the heavenly currency that believers use to purchase salvation.\"For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:\r\n\r\nEphesians 2 vs.8. Faith is indispensable to anyone who needs blessings from God. Whatever you need from God must go along with your faith.\r\n\r\n\"But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. Hebrews 11 vs. 6. It was faith that made God to love Abraham, and even called him the father of faith. You must be a man or woman of faith before you can say anything and get the heavenly host committed.\r\n\r\nEverything we are doing in the Lord must come by faith.\r\n\r\n\"For we walk by faith, not by sight\" 2\r\n\r\nCorinthians 5vs.7\r\n\r\nLook at that woman that her son died and went to see Prophet Elisha, and when the Prophetasked her \"Is it well? \"The woman said, \"It is well.\" She said that in faith and walked in faith. 2 Kings 4 vs. 26 \" Please run now to meet her, and say to her, \'Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?\" And she answered, \"It is well\".\r\n\r\nThe woman knew God could make her son live again through the Prophet. And to the glory of God, the son came back to life. Don\'t forget that the woman left the dead son at home, but she took the step of faith. Weeping could not wake her son but faith brought him back to life. Many prefer weeping to exercising their faith. God does not need your weeping; neither the years you have spent in the Lord nor your position. What He needs is your faith. Apostle Paul applied faith in his ministry; he said, he could do all things in Christ. Philippians 4 vs. 13 \"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me\".\r\n\r\nMany claim to be Christians but find it very hard to apply the principles of faith. They prefer looking up to a physical man to looking unto God for their miracle. Hebrews 12 vs. 2 \"looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God\".\r\n\r\nChrist is the finisher of our faith. You are to set your eyes on God, who is the only one that can perfect your faith. No one can see God without faith. It\'s the money they spend in heaven. Without faith, you can\'t obtain a heavenly product. \r\n\r\n\r\n', ' \r\n\r\n\r\nHOPE FOR THE HOPELESS\r\n\r\n\"As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations, before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were. Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations; according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be. And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara\'s womb: Romans 4 vs. 17-19\r\n\r\nJust imagine what God did in the life of Sarah. Nothing could make her bear a child again due to her old age. All hope must have been lost. The body, womb and her strength were already weak to the level that she could not even think of bearing children anymore. But the King of kings and the Lord of lords said, \"It\'s not over until it is over\". He made impossibility to be possible. What a man could not do was possible through the power of God. Halleluyah!\r\n\r\n\"And they said unto him, where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.\r\n\r\nAnd he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him. Now Abraham and Sarah were old and wellstricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?\r\n\r\nAnd the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old? Is anything too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son\". Genesis 18 vs. 9-14\r\n\r\nWhen the visitors had finished eating, they declared that Sarah will embrace a baby boy in a matter of one year. It was so funny to Sarah that when she heard the statement she laughed, because of her old age. But God cannot lie. He cannot say what He cannot do. At same time we cannot blame Sarah for her laughterbecause such a thing has never happened before and cannot happen in the midst of man.\r\n\r\nMedically speaking, such a woman cannot bear a child again, let alone children at that old age of 75 years. \"God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good? Numbers 23 vs. 19. Our God is not a liar that He will say a thing and will not do it. What He said concerning Sarah came to pass at the particular year He told Abraham. The hopeless situation was revived. \"And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken. For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him,whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac\". Genesis 21 VS. 1-3. Sarah became a mother of a child.\r\n\r\nLet\'s also see the case of the woman of Zarephath and her sonthat had already lost hope. The only food they had was to be eaten and thereafter prepared to die. But the God of possibilities visited them with a miracle. \"And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand. And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die. And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son. For thus saiththe LORD God of Israel, The barrel of shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth. 1 Kings 17 vs. 11-14\r\n\r\nGod told Prophet Elijah to go to that woman, and that she would be the one that would feed him for that time. It was a time of famine. Prophet Elijah thought he would get food from the woman. On getting there, the woman told the prophet that there was no food for him. But the prophet believed that God could not lie. While the woman and her son were preparing to die, God changed their situation. She gave the man of God what she had and God blessed her vessels throughout the time of the famine. This woman did not feel the effects of the famine in any way.\r\n\r\n\"And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubledto know the dream. Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live forever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation. The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill. But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof. They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it. The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me. But if ye will not make known unto me thedream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof. The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not man upon the earth that can shew the king\'s matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean. And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh. For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon\". Daniel 2 vs. 3-12\r\n\r\nWhat a terrible situation! The king had a dream that he could not remember let alonetalk of its interpretation. The king called all the magicians and the wise men to tell him the dream that he had and the interpretation. It was quite a difficult task for them and the king said if they could not tell him the dream and interpret it, he would destroy all of them including the children of God, Daniel and his colleagues. Even as hard as it looked, Daniel and his colleagues sent a message to the king to give them three days, after which the dream would be revealed to the king on the fourth day. These people prayed to God and He answered them.\r\n\r\n\"Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his: And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding: revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him. I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king\'s matter\". Daniel 2 vs. 19-23\r\n\r\nThey were already seeing death before now, but God that changes hopelessness to hope manifested Himself. He revealed the dream and the interpretation to Daniel and his friends.\r\n\r\nDo you remember the story of the man that was born blind whom Jesus gave sight?\r\n\r\n\"And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man whichwas blind from his birth. And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing. The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged? Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, Iam he. Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened? He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight. John 9\r\n\r\nvs. 1-11\r\n\r\nEven the disciples of Jesus asked whether it was this blind man that sinned or his parents. Jesus answered that none of them sinned, but to show the glory of God over the blind man\'s situation. I know that both the man and his parents must have lost hope about his condition. But God moved in another way beyond the knowledge of man by giving him eyes to see. When people saw him, they could not believe he was the one. By the time God finishes with you, an avalanche of testimonies will surround you in Jesus name.Isaac also was in the land where there was a terrible famine. There was no rain and no seed germinated. The situation of the land was totally bad that to feed was a problem. However, God told Isaac to stay in that land in order to revive his hopeless situation to living hope.\r\n\r\n\"And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar. And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of: Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which Isware unto Abraham thy father; And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars ofheaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws. Genesis 26 vs. 1-5.\r\n\r\nGod had many promises for Isaac in a land where rain failed to fall and famine affected the whole land. Despite all these odd circumstances, God promised He would make Isaac great. The people of the land planted on their land and nothing positive came out of it, because of the effects of the famine. But Isaac planted on the same land and harvested bountifully beyond the imaginations of an ordinary person. \"Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him. And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great: Genesis\r\n\r\n26 vs. 12-13\r\n\r\nGod made him great to the length that people of the land became jealous of him. God can use anything to turn your life around. Don\'t lose hope over that situation you are facing. There is nothing God cannot do. \"Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there anything too hard for me? Jeremiah 32vs.27. There is nothing God cannot change or correct. Satan can only use deceit to corrupt what God had perfected in order to destroy your faith.\r\n\r\nSee what happened in the case of Lazarus; the two sisters and the rest of the family had lost hope, because Lazarus had already been buried. But the Doer, the Giver and the Taker changed the dead hope to living hope.\"These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; bu I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. John 11 vs. 11-12\r\n\r\nJesus told His disciples that Lazarus was sleeping and He needed to wake him up. The disciples were surprised hearing that from Jesus. What people conclusively said was \'death\' was what Jesus called \'sleep\'.\r\n\r\n\"Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee. Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, thoughhe were dead, yet shall he live\" John 11 vs. 21-25\r\n\r\nIt was very hard to believe that Lazarus could still come back to life. Nothing otherwise was hoped for because they had uried him and he was already stinking. When Jesus got to his grave, He used the power of resurrection to change his story from death to a living soul.\r\n\r\n\"Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me. And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot withgraveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go. John 11 vs. 41-44\r\n\r\nFriend, what is that thing that is dead in your life, home, business or place of work? Don\'t lose hope over it as God can still change the situation for the better. If Jesus could wake Lazarus that had died for four days, there\'s nothing He cannot do. Call upon God over that situation, He will manifest His mighty power and you will glorify Him. There was no hope over the case of Lazarus; but because God was in charge of the case, a miracle took place. Let God take charge of your case, there is nothing He can\'t do.\r\n\r\nImagine what happened in the first marriage in the Scriptures; Supposing Jesus was not invited, they would have received an opendisgrace. Thank God, Jesus was present. \"And the third day there was a marriage in\r\n\r\nCana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there: And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage. And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it. When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew; the governor of the feast called the bridegroom\" John 2:1-9\r\n\r\nThe bride groom must have run out of money. Luckily enough, Jesus was fully invited to the wedding. So when the problem arose, they quickly called on Jesus and He gave them the solution. Jesus did what a man could not do for them.\r\n\r\nWhatever God approves is always perfect and good. Don\'t take your case to man, but to the creator of heaven and earth. He is the one that has the perfect and lasting solution. Man will only add to your problems, but God will put an end to it and give you rest. Come to Him, you can never be put to shame. As you are doing that, God in heaven will prove Himself in your life in Jesus name. Amen.\r\n', '\r\nA NEW LIFE\r\n\r\n\"Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new\".11 Corinthians 5 vs. 17\r\n\r\nA new life cannot be compared to an old life; because a new life in Christ is the full nature of God, while the old life reflects the picture of the devil that is prone to sin, carnality and calamity.\r\n\r\nThe Scripture says if any man is in the Lord, heis a new creature. This implies that the Adamic nature is no more in you but the fullness of God. \"Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. Romans 6 vs. 4\r\n\r\nThe new life in Christ has remarkably changed the lives of many people. It was the old nature of Lazarus that made him a sick and later a dead person. But immediately he was raised from the dead, he became a new Lazarus. We were not told he ate with Jesus before he died, but after his death and resurrection, he ate with Jesus.\r\n\r\n\"Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. There they made him a supper; andMartha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him. John 12 vs. 1-2 Eating with Jesus has a significant meaning. If you accept Jesus as your Lord and saviour, you will be given a new life. Jesus will live with you and dine with you, because you are no more an old person but rather a new person in the Lord.\r\n\r\nA new life will make everything concerning you to be new. No devil can attack you or embarrass your personality. \"What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?\"Romans 8vs.31\r\n\r\nEveryone that has a new life in Christ has the full backing of God and they are untouchable to the enemies.\"No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of theservants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\nIsaiah 54 vs. 17\r\n\r\nNo sickness or barrenness in any form can overcome you, because you are the temple of the Holy Ghost. \"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? 1 Corithians 3 vs. 16\r\n\r\nIf the Holy Ghost dwells in you, there\'s no attack of the devil that can affect your body. When Jesus was told about the sickness and death of Lazarus, He was not moved about it because Lazarus had Christ in his life. When Jesus got to his grave, He called the living Lazarus to come out of the dead.\r\n\r\nOnce you are a new person in the Lord, whatever the enemy might have done to you is just for a while and cannot be permanent. \"And when Paul had gathered a bundle ofsticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand. And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live. And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm. Acts 28 vs. 3-5.\r\n\r\nThe people that saw the viper fasten itself on Paul\'s hand thought it would harm him, but Paul was a new man that carried the presence of God upon himself. The viper could not hurt him. If you are a child of God, there\'s no satanic attack that can have any effect on your life, even when God allows evil things to happen to you. \"Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. Psalm 105 vs. 15. \r\n\r\nThe special anointing of God is upon\r\n\r\nanyone that is in the Lord. It is not only the ministers of the gospel that carry the anointing of God; but both the ministers and every believer.\r\n\r\nA new life in Christ guarantees safety, easy life, favour, mercy, honour, breakthrough etc. It is an opportunity for you to know Jesus and give your life to Him. Giving your life to Jesus will enable you to receive the power of God.\r\n\r\n\"But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: John 1 vs. 12.\"\r\n\r\nNo one can live successfully on earth without the power of God. Your sonship in the Lord is also very sure. \"The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God\" Romans 8 vs. 16.Whoever that accepts Jesus as his Lord and saviour will possess the spirit of God that will confirm his sonship. Accept Jesus today in order to enjoy a new life in Christ.\r\n\r\nLED BY THE SPIRIT\r\n\r\n\"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. Romans 8 vs. 14 As you can see what is happening in the\r\n\r\nworld today, whoever that is not led by the spirit of God might also be a victim of the evils befalling the mighty ones.\r\n\r\n\"I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye. Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee. Psalm 32 vs. 8-9\r\n\r\nHaving a new life in Christ also enables us to know the plans of God for our lives. Andknowing the mind of God for your life will help you to please God. He will also teach you the things you don\'t know about life. There are a lot of things you are yet to know on earth, until you possess the mind of Christ, you can never know or discover them.\"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Philippians 2 vs. 5\r\n\r\nPossessing the mind of Christ will help you to discover and recover what you desire in the Lord. A situation where you cannot discover yourself will make you a victim of ignorance and stagnancy and turn you to a slave.\r\n\r\nIGNORANCE\r\n\r\nPart of the problems that many Christians are facing is hypocrisy and ignorance. Truly they are good believers but they do not know their rights in the Lord.\"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children. Hosea 4 vs.6\r\n\r\nIgnorance is the only mountain before Christians. Knowing the mind of God for your life will help to facilitate the blessings of God you desire.\r\n\r\nGod is having good things for His people. This is the right time for every believer to enjoy the benefits of God. Special grace to enjoy the blessings of God will come upon you in Jesus name. Amen.\r\n\r\nA new life will give birth to a new living. Be a partaker of this and don\'t neglect the grace of God for your life. God loves you dearly.Come unto Him and He will give you a new life.\r\n\r\n', '', '', '', 'ziggyadex@gmail.com', '2023-04-18', '');

Most people believe starting the journey to success from a high level is the best. But this principle is absolutely not true.\r\n\r\nEven the almighty God that created the heaven and the earth started it from a small and not a high level. The whole world is over seven billion in population, but don\'t forget that God started it with just two people in the persons of Adam and Eve.\r\n\r\n\"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. \"Genesis 1 vs. 26-27Every great institution or establishment that you are seeing in the country today started from a small level and then grew to become great.\r\n\r\nJust as other countries of the world have their own different currencies; Kobo is the smallest unit of currency in Nigeria. It is very easy to underrate, but it has the power to turn a life around. Whoever that follows the principles guiding the good use of Kobo, will reap the benefits.\r\n\r\nAs you are reading this book, you will discover the mystery that makes Kobo, even as small as it is, very important to the financial growth of individuals and the Nigerian society at large.\r\nI pray that God will open your understanding to discover the hidden treasure of Kobo in Jesus\' name.

It helps to achieve something in life. There are different ways of exercising power. There is power you can exercise by your physical strength. And there is political power or power you can exert by virtue of your position or authority and so many others.\r\n\r\nWhile Kobo is the smallest unit of currency spent in Nigeria, other countries like Ghana, Togo, South Africa, USA etc. have their own currencies in different names. Kobo is very small, but it has the power to grow and make one to be great. Even as small at it looks, it\'s powerful in making one\'s life meaningful.\r\n\r\nIt is a pity that many in the Nigerian society are underrating it, because it is very small in nature. There was a time I met someone, who said he was looking for a big amount of money to start life with. And I told him that he could not get big money anywhere, except small. He remained in that position of looking for big money for many years. Later on, I told him point blank that if he was not being careful, he would soon become a thief, because whoever is running after what his or her level cannot attain, would definitely end up being who he doesn\'t want to become in life in a negative way.\r\nWhen God started stirring His potentials on earth, and wanted to make man, he started with just Adam and Eve.\r\n\r\n\"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.\r\n\r\nAnd God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.\" Gen 1 vs. 26-28 Every small level or beginning in life, usually has the full backing of God.\r\n\r\n\"Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father\'s good pleasure to give you the kingdom. \"Luke 12 vs.32\r\n\r\nFurthermore, anything that wants to last and stand the test of time, must begin from a small level, as the foundation of everything in life matters a lot. \"If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?\"Psalm 11vs. 3\r\n\r\nI could recollect the time we started this God-given ministry in my sitting room. The very first day, it was just me and my wife. And it was the year I was ordained as a Pastor of the Gospel in Christ Apostolic Church (C.A.C)\r\n\r\nJust imagine an ordained Pastor starting a ministry\r\n\r\ninside the room, with just him and his wife. I was called to come and head a big church, but I told them I was not sent to do that, but to start my own.\r\n\r\nDespite dissuasion and moral discouragement from different places, I stood on what God told me. And to the glory of God, I am somebody today. Many callings or businesses had ended suddenly, because of unprofitable benefits derived from wrong places. What you don\'t suffer for, cannot last and there will be no story to tell in future. It is not what you are eating that matters, but how you got it. Just flash back and see how far have you gone in the journey of your life. Don\'t forget that heaven helps those who help themselves. Try to evaluate your journey in life. Kobo is a very small unit of currency, but it can catapult your glory to operate at a very high level in life.\r\n\r\n\"And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me. For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also? \"Gen. 30:29-30 Laban promised Jacob to make him great. Whoever that promises to give you a huge amount of money to get you started in life, is neither your friend nor helper, but an enemy of your progress.\r\n\r\nThe helper you have pinned your hope on will keep on promising you, but you will be disappointed that you will not get the help or money promised, until you have lost time, knowledge and strength to do something meaningful in life. Start life with what you have and God will give you every necessary support to lift up to a high level. I pray you will testify in Jesus\' name.\r\n', 'CHARACTERISTICS OF KOBO\r\n-----------------------\r\nAs small as Kobo is to other Nigeria currencies, it has its own characteristics. By the time you go through these fundamental qualities of Kobo, you will value it more than ever before. Kobo is very powerful.\r\n\r\n1. SMALLEST IN VALUE AND SIZE: Among other Nigeria currencies, Kobo is the smallest unit in value and size. It\'s very portable and common in the society. Children and even adults can hold it in their hands with ease. You do not need anything to move it from one place to another. A man can put it in his pocket, while a woman can drop it in her bag. It\'s indeed very small in nature.\r\n\r\n2. POWER TO INCREASE: As small as it is, Kobo is very easy to gather or save. You can find it more convenient to be saving it somewhere every day, if you decide to be doing that. There was a time I tried this system, and before I knew it, I have already saved a reasonable amount of money. But one would not have tried this with any other money of a bigger value, as financial needs or challenges will not allow one to save and get a substantial amount of money. So Kobo has the potential of getting saved easily and increase in value; but this may be relatively difficult with money of a higher value.\r\n\r\n3. EASY TO CONTROL: The way you can control kobo, you cannot control money of higher denominations like that. Kobo does not give room for sleepless nights like big money. No one will notice you have Kobo, but big money will attract the attention of people. \r\n\r\n4. EASY TO GET: It\'s easier to get Kobo than big money. Before you can be sure of getting big money, you would have gone through a lot of challenges. But to get Kobo is as easy as anything.\r\n\r\n5. POWER TO LAST: Small money can stay long in your hands. You can put kobo in a small box for a very long time; but you can\'t try that with big money as financial demands will force you to spend it. You cannot have one hundred thousand naira in your bank account and allow a financial problem of fifty thousand to embarrass you. The next thing you will do is to go to your bank and withdraw it, to save the situation. But you will not think of solving such a financial problem with Kobo; hence it will remain where you are accumulating it.\r\n\r\n6. LESS SPENDING TENDENCY: Of course, I have said it before that the propensity or tendency to spend Kobo is not high, compared to money of higher denominations. No one usually regards something small as anything. And if you have any problem to solve with money, your mind will not go to Kobo, but rather the big money in your possession.\r\n\r\n7. POWER TO TURN ALIFE AROUND: There was a time I needed money for a plan. In order to achieve this, I started to gather money of small denominations for three to four months. Surprisingly, by the time I checked the box that I was keeping the money, I realized more than the amount I needed for my plan.\r\nLet us consider our banking system for instance. Your bank helps you to save your money. And after a period of time, you will receive a message from the bank informing you that you have been charged, say ten naira, for all the SMS alerts you have been receiving regarding your account with them. Most of us don\'t count all these little bank charges as anything; but to the banks, that ten naira they charge you for SMS alerts for example; if deducted from one million customers, they will realize ten million naira. You can now see that Kobo can turn your life around. Do not underrate it.\r\n\r\n8. IT COMMANDS GOD\'S SUPPORT: It\'s the will of God to make a small level to grow or increase. Whoever that begins his plan to progress from a small level, will enjoy the support of God; as God Himself also started from a small level.\r\n\r\n\"Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father\'s good pleasure to give you the kingdom. \"Luke 12 vs. 32\r\nAs you commence that your journey to success in a little way, you are sure of gaining God\'s backing and His Kingdom.', 'INSPIRATION\r\n-------------\r\nBefore you can be conscious of the importance of Kobo or any money of low value, something must have inspired it in your mind. It is not what you can just start doing without inspiration.\r\nThe following are the factors that may inspire someone to be conscious of how important every kobo is:\r\n\r\n1. FRUSTRATION: If one finds oneself in a state of being confused or frustrated, and help seems to be coming from nowhere, such a situation may force one to consider kobo as the last resort. \"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest. \"Eccl. 9 vs. 10\r\n\r\n\r\n2. LEADING OF THE SPIRIT: It was the spirit of God that inspired Jacob to have his own sheep in the house of Laban.\r\n\"And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods. And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink. And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted. And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban\'s cattle.\r\nAnd it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods. But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban\'s, and the stronger Jacob\'s. And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses. \"Genesis 30 vs. 37-43\r\nJacob would have left Laban without getting anything from the man\'s belongings. But God almighty inspired Jacob to see the glory of success through a common stick. I pray, God will inspire you to discover the way out of your problem in Jesus\' name. Amen.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. RIGHT INFORMATION: Good information can inspire you to start life from a small level. It was the right information that Nehemiah gathered that helped him to build the wall of Jerusalem.\r\n\"That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire. And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven, \"Nehemiah 1 vs. 2-4\r\nThe importance of information to any great achievement cannot be underestimated. It is correct information that can motivate someone to use any available resources wisely, no matter how small, to achieve his goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. FUTURE PLAN: What you have at hand now is very important to any plan you are making. There was a time I planned to achieve a particular goal and there was no one I could turn to for money. Sol resorted to gathering the little money I had. And to my utmost surprise, I was able to start the business with the little I was able\r\nto gather.\r\n\"For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?\"  Luke 14 vs. 28\r\n\r\n\r\n5. MEDITATION: The book of Joshua tells us to meditate about the Word all the time.\r\n\"This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. \"Joshua 1 vs. 8\r\nThrough meditation you can be inspired to gather the little you have for the achievement of your goal. Every good thinker ends up having the way out.\r\n\r\n6. WISDOM OF GOD: \"If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct. \"Eccl. 10 vs. 10. Wisdom is a good treasure that God gives to His children to do exploits on earth. It makes things easy to achieve in life. Gathering or saving Kobo for a certain pliswisdom of God in action. You need wisdom to achieve a better tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. RIGHT ADVICE: It was wrong advice that destroyed the government of Rehoboam.\r\n\"And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people? And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them. then they will be thy servants forever. But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which stood before him:\"\r\nIf you have a good and right-minded person as your adviser, you will surely get to the top on time.\r\n\r\nYour inspiration to consider every kobo as being important, can come fromany of the above mentioned factors. And once you are inspired, you are sure of getting there. I pray, you will reach your goal in Jesus\' name. Amen.', 'HOW TO MULTIPLY YOUR KOBO\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nThere is nothing that happens by chance in life. It is not enough to be conscious of how Kobo can change one\'s life alone, it\'s very important to know what you need to do to make it increase to your desire. The following are the attributes that bring multiplying effects to Kobo:\r\n\r\n1. CLEAR VISION: It was the vision of God for Abraham that made him to take the giant steps of faith, to leave his father\'s house to where God told\r\nhim to go.\r\n\"Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father\'s house, unto a land that I will shew thee: And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. \"Genesis 12 vs. 1-3.\r\n\r\nA vision is a spiritual force that brings about fulfillment to every visionary. If you are sure of your vision, you can never wait until you are pushed before you push yourself. A vision is very powerful to stimulate a person into action. Majority of people that value Kobo are people of clear vision that know that from that Kobo they can achieve something great in life.\r\n\r\n2. PLANNING: Another element that can multiply Kobo is planning. God will only tell you what to do, but He will not plan for you.\r\n\"For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it? Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him, Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish. \"Luke 14 vs. 28-30\r\nWhoever that fails to plan, is planning to fail. Planning is a step of wisdom. It gives you a clear picture or details of what you want to do. Also, it helps you to plan adequately over what is on ground. Of course you cannot plan more than what you have at hand. Planning is very good. It\'s very important that you plan before you do anything. If you fail to plan, people will mock you if you fail to succeed.\r\n\r\n3. GOD\'S INTERVENTION: If you want to succeed in whatever you are doing, you must involve God. Thank God that Jesus Christ was in the first marriage in the New Testament. They had problem of wine and because Jesus was there, the problem turned to a testimony.\r\n\"And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.3 And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. \"John 2 vs. 5-8\r\nAnything you want to do, you need God to take perfect control in order to achieve success. \"But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible. \"Mathew 19 vs. 26\r\nThere are a lot of things that are not possible for man, but if God is involved, a lot shall be achieved. You need God in your life, business or career.\r\n\r\n4. RIGHT TIME: Everything in life has a definite time. Even our God does not joke with time in everything He does. Jesus came to the world at the appointed time.\r\n\"But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law\", Galatians 4 vs. 4.\r\nAnything you want to do in life, you must work with time.\r\n\"To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: \"Eccl. 3 vs. 1 The first miracle that happened through Christ, followed the right time of God. Time is one of the factors that can multiply your kobo. There is time for everything is life.\r\n\r\n5. LOCATION: It is true that the Scripture says that small flock should not entertain fear; yes, but such flock must be in the right location of God. \"Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father\'s good pleasure to give you the kingdom. \"Luke 12 vs. 32. Where cars are being sold, if you go there to display pepper and tomato to sell, nobody will patronize you, because the location is wrong for such a business. Isaac was in the land of the Philistines where rained failed to fall and seeds did not germinate. Despite that, God told him to remain in the land, which means that he was in the right location.\r\n\"Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father\'s house, unto a land that I will shew thee: And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. \"Genesis 26 vs. 1-3.\r\nOnce you are in the right location, you are sure of the right solution.\r\n\r\n6. HARDWORK: Before kobo can multiply in your hands, you have to cultivate the habit of working hard. Many are lazy but they want the increase of God. \"But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work. \"John 5 vs. 17.\r\nEven when Our Lord Jesus was on earth, He worked hard day and night, for Him to have a good report. Similarly, it was the good and hard work of the elders in the Bible that made them to have good reports.\r\n\"For by it the elders obtained a good report. \"Heb.11 vs. 2\r\nThe Bible affirms it that the Lazy should not eat.\r\nHard work will help you to achieve a better goal on that little thing you are doing. Give no room for laziness. Laziness decreases blessings while hard work makes productivity to increase.\r\n\r\n7. DISCIPLINE: Many are not disciplined when it comes to saving money of low value like Kobo. They are so extravagant that they can spend their money on anything that cannot really make them grow from the small level they are at present or add value to their lives. They lack financial discipline.\r\n\"But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king\'s meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. \"Daniel 1 vs. 8\r\nJust imagine how Daniel disciplined himself in a place where there was enough food and drink. He did this because of his plan and what he wanted to achieve. He disciplined himself and in the end, he got the glory.\r\nOne thing I want you to understand is that your tomorrow is more important than your today. Discipline your hands, eyes, mouth, and your legs. As you do this, God will help you in Jesus\' name. Amen.\r\n\r\n8. FAITHFULLNESS: Many are not faithful to themselves, much less to others or God. If you are not faithful with what you have in your present small level, how would you be faithful ata higher\r\nlevel?\r\n\"Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. \"1 Cor. 4 vs. 2.\r\nYour faithfulness is very important to your 230 progress. Allow faithfulness to take full charge of So your life. For instance, you are required to be faithful in paying your tithe and offerings. Tithe is what I like to calla spiritual antibiotic that kills any devourer that may want to attack your productivity. A situation where you fail to pay the tithe from your income, you are inviting the arrow of Satan to affect your business or career. Pay this to God with all faithfulness. No one does that and remains the same. Be faithful in obeying God\'s order.\r\n\r\n9. DEDICATION: Anything you must do successfully must come from the depth of your heart and that is what enhances dedication.\r\n\"And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.\r\nAnd they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. \"Genesis 11 vs. 3-6.\r\nHave you ever considered how committed the people that dedicated their time and lives to build that tower to reach heaven? If God had not confused their language, they would have succeeded and actualized their goal. Dedication is a strong force that promotes one from a small to a higher level in life. It will turn one kobo to a million naira. Be dedicated to your assignment.\r\n\r\n10. TRUST YOURSELF: Many would have succeeded in life, but they don\'t even believe in themselves that they can succeed in anything.\r\n\"I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. \"Phil. 4 vs. 13.\r\nThat Scripture says, you can do all things in Christ. If you are a true child of God, once you have the support of God in whatever you want to do, you will surely succeed. Do not allow the fear of the unknown to overshadow you. Since Christ can never fail, you will not fail also in Jesus\' name.\r\nBelieve and trust yourself. And I pray that you shall get there in Jesus\' name. Amen.\r\n\r\n11. OBSERVATION: This is an act of noticing or perceiving things. If you want to rise at that small level that you are or want your kobo to increase, you need to cultivate the habit of observation. \"In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem. \"Daniel 9 vs. 2.\r\nIt was the observation of Daniel that helped them to discover the year they would spend in the land of their enemy. Always be observant of what will help you to achieve your goal in life\r\n\r\n2. JOY: \"Rejoice in the Lord always : and again I say, Rejoice. \"Philippians 4 vs. 4.\r\nIn every situation, always give room to joy in your heart. No matter how small the business may be, allow joy to fill your heart. Joy commands more solutions to your faith. It\'s also one of the fruits of faith that has the power to multiply kobo to increase in your hands. Let the joy of God fill your heart always. The joy of God in every believer\'s heart must not be seasonal or conditional, but always.', 'OPPOSITION\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nThere is no step of progress taken in life that does not attract opposition. \"For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries. \"1 Cor. 16 vs. 9. No matter how small the business or dream may be, one opposition or the other will rise against it. Let us look at the following opposition of Kobo:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. SELF-IMPORTANCE: Many would have succeeded through the power of Kobo or small beginning, but because of their self-importance and overrating of themselves; they have not been able to achieve anything. Some who believe so much in their university degrees or managerial skills have killed their glory in life. Whoever that ridicules a small beginning, will never get to the top of glory.\r\n\r\n\"I can do all things through Christ which strengthened me. \"Philippians 4 vs. 13.\r\nA good Christian should not indulge in conceit or self-importance. Satan is using that to destroy many people\'s glory.\r\nThere was a time I was told about one sister, who was working in a finance company, where she was not doing well. So she decided to resign and start up a business with a small amount of money, without bothering about the level she has attained or what people will say. She went ahead and to the glory of God, she is something today. Self-importance or being conceited about the high level you have attained in life is a killer of destiny. This will make you to despise starting from a small level to climb the ladder of success in life. Don\'t allow this to rob you of a small opportunity to make it in life. \r\n\r\n2. LAZINESS: This is a major killer of destiny. Whoever that allows the spirit of laziness to possess him will never smell breakthrough in\r\nlife.\r\n\"But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work. \"John 5 vs. 17.\r\nOur Lord Jesus was not a lazy person when he was on earth to do the work of God. It\'s the spirit of laziness that gives birth to procrastination. A testimony of success or breakthrough is not meant for the lazy, but a hardworking person.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. INDISCIPLINE: Some cannot discipline themselves. And any indiscipline person cannot make use of Kobo, much less of planning to survive through it.\r\n\"But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king\'s meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. \"Daniel 1 vs.8\r\nDaniel was a disciplined man. He saw beyond what people were eating in the house of the king.\r\nSome cannot see beyond their present level and that is why discipline is not important to them. Indiscipline is an opposition to any progress in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. LACK OF KNOWLEDGE: A situation where people don\'t have the right knowledge, they will never think of making progress or planning for future.\r\n\"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children. \"Hosea 4 vs. 6\r\nKnowledge is very important to anyone that wants to make progress in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. CARELESSNESS: Many have thrown away their glory through their acts of carelessness. Whoever that allows the spirit of carelessness to rule his life, will never receive honour from man.\r\nPaul the Apostle told the Disciples to take heed about the sheep committed to their hands. \"Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. \"Acts 20 vs. 28.\r\nSome are so careless to the extent that what could have made their tomorrow colourful have been destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. WRONG ADVICE: Every good step to progress has the backing of a good adviser. The advice you accept towards your goal matters a lot. Who is your adviser? Has he made or making any progress in life?\r\n\"He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed. \"Proverb 13 vs. 20\r\nIf you walk with the wise, they will lead you aright and not astray.\r\nATTACK OF THE DEVIL: I have said it earlier that there is no step to progress in life that does not attract opposition or the attack of the devil. Satan does not want anybody to succeed in life. But with the help of God, you shall succeed in Jesus\' name. Amen.\r\n\r\n\"For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.\"1 Cor. 16 vs. 9.\r\nSome come from wicked families that possess the spirit of Satan. How would these make progress? Satan is not happy with the progress of believers. These are the factors that stand as opposition against the power of Kobo.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, whoever that wants to progress in life or record an outstanding achievement, must follow the rules of starting from a small level. Even God, Our Creator started small. The small that you have is enough to take you to the top. Don\'t underrate it and you shall get there in Jesus\' name. Amen. It is a seed of corn that gives birth to uncountable cobs of corns. Start from somewhere and you shall testify in Jesus\' name. Amen\r\n', '', '', '', '', '', 'ziggyadex@gmail.com', '2023-04-10', 'view_ebook.php');

Companion  \r\n4. Special Grace  \r\n5. Mercy of God  \r\n6. Power and Help  \r\n7. Knowledge, Wisdom and Understanding', 'Introduction\r\n\r\nAt a quick glance, this book, \'the needs for the needy might be Misunderstood by some people to be aimed at addressing the needs of the needy in the society, like the less- privileged, the poor, roadside or street beggars and so on. Some people who confidently believe they are not in need of anything in life, might even conclude that the word \'needy\' does not apply to them in any sense because of their wealth and worth on earth. I want you to understand that everyone is a needy either rich or poor. We are all needy individuals on earth. You cannot satisfy all your needs and what you have cannot solve all your problems. The rich also cry. Since the day Satan made the man to sin, he became needy. In other words, sin made the man to be needy. When God created the man and placed him in the Garden of Eden, both him and his wife lacked nothing and were comfortable. God was their supplier.\r\n\r\n\"And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil\" Gen 2 vs. 8-9\r\n\r\nImmediately sin came into the life of the man; God sent him and the woman out of the Garden of Eden that used to meet their needs. And they consequently became needy. \"Therefore the LORD God sent him out of the garden of Eden to till the ground from which he was taken. So He drove out the man; and He placed cherubim at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life. Gen 3 vs. 23-24\r\n\r\nA man once said, if he could have money, he would not need anything again in life because money would solve all problems for him. He was fortunate he had money, but later became terribly sick to the point of death. He spent a huge sum of money in a famous and expensive hospital they took him for treatment. But despite all the money spent, he could still not be cured. It was then it dawned on him that money was not the only thing he needed in life. Somebody told him about Jesus Christ, the great healer.\r\n\r\n\"But he was wounded for our transgressions,\r\n\r\nhe was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed\". Isaiah 53 vs.5 He said he needed that Jesus. He gave his life to Him and was completely healed without the assistance of money or man. In the end, the man believed that he was a needy person.\r\n\r\nIn as much as you are a human being living on earth, you are completely a needy person; whether you are president or governor, managing director or messenger, we are all needy. Whatever you acquire on earth, you can never be satisfied, as you\'ll still need one thing or the other. What a man needs is more than what he can ever have. The needs of man have no end. There is no day on earth that man will not need one thing or the other. It\'s not only road side beggars that are needy; whatever a man lacks has made him a needy individual also.\r\n\r\n\"The needs for the needy\" as you will later find out in this book, concern both the rich and the poor. I pray that as you read God will satisfy all your needs in Jesus name. Amen', 'CopyrightÂ©2013, Pastor T. J.

God sent Adam and Eve out of the garden of satisfaction to the world of struggle and needs.\r\n\r\n\"therefore the LORD God sent him out of the garden of Eden to till the ground from which he was taken. So He drove out the man; and He placed cherubim at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.\" Genesis 3 vs. 23-24\r\n\r\nWhen they were still in the Garden of Eden, they had all they needed at their disposal. They had everything including God. They didn\'t have any reason whatsoever to cry for anything before getting it. Before they would ask for something, God would have provided it for them.\r\n\r\nThe plan of God for man was not to be needy, but to be glorious and wonderful people. But sin regrettably made man to become needy.\r\n\r\n\"And God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.\" So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. Then God blessed them, and God said to them, \"Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.\" Genesis 1 vs. 26-28\r\n\r\nGod created man to be like Him and have dominion over what He created, for man\'s comfort and fulfillment of His plan for mankind. What a pitiable and miserable life of being needy we now find ourselves!\r\n\r\nSince the time God sent man out of the Garden of Eden, man have been struggling to measure up with the original standard of God. It is not very easy for any man to meet all his needs in life. Any challenge he overcomes to achieve a particular goal, opens the door for another challenge. In the beginning, there was nothing like that. Sin came into the life of the man and turned his hitherto celebrated and glorious life into a struggling one. The man became needy through sin and consequent anger of God towards him.\r\n\r\n\"And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life\" Genesis 3 vs. 22-24\r\n\r\nThen he began to move from pillar to post for survival. The journey of life became rough and dangerous. He was no more enjoying a comfortable life, but a life of struggle to survive. I could recollect the time I was in our village when our mother was still alive. One day we had no food to eat at home. It got to a\r\npoint that our mother began to cry, as she could not help the situation to get us something to eat for that day. We had clothes to wear but usually there was no food to eat. This is due to the needy nature of man that I am talking about. What a poor widow our mother was. She became a widow following our father\'s death several years back. She was shouldering all our responsibilities alone without any form of assistance from anyone, except the living God that usually sent help in times of need.\r\n\r\n\"Give us help from trouble, For vain is the help of man\" Psalm 108 vs. 12.\r\n\r\npray we will not experience the anger of God in Jesus name. Amen. When God was angry with the whole earth during the time of Noah, He used flood to destroy the world; mankind, animals and plants. And then it remained the family of Noah on earth.\r\n\r\n\"And the LORD said to Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation. Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female; and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and female. Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female: to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth. For yet seven days and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth. Genesis 7 vs. 14\r\n\r\nSimilar to that is Sodom and Gomorrah. When they sinned against God, His anger sent fire from heaven and consumed them all, and their names were blotted.\r\n\"Now the men of Sodom were wicked and were sinning greatly against the LORD.\" Genesis 13 vs.13\r\n\r\n\"Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven; And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt. And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD: And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace. Genesis 19 vs. 24 vs. 28\r\n\r\nWhen Pharaoh and his people refused to let the people of Israel go, God also used His anger to destroy them at the Red sea.\r\n\r\n\"And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen. And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them. \"Exodus 14 vs. 26-28\r\n\r\nMoses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the sea went back to its place. The Egyptians were fleeing toward it, and the LORD swept them into the sea. The water flowed back and covered the chariots and horsemen the entire army of Pharaoh that had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them survived. Sin provokes the anger of God.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the anger of God that led man out of the garden of Eden. I pray, sin will not destroy your glory in Jesus name Amen. The man that was comfortable in the Garden of Eden became a wanderer, looking for means to meet his needs. Some leave Nigeria for United States of America for example, in order to meet their needs or seek for greener pasture as they usually say; but it always amounts to nothing. What a fruitless pursuit! It\'s not possible for a man to have everything he needs on earth irrespective of his status.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN BECAME NAKED\r\n\r\nGod used his glorious power to form the man and cover him with glory. The man looked like Him and had His nature. Sin however, brought about nakedness. Glory was the best cloth that God made for Adam and Eve. What a wonderful garment! No tailor on earth can sew it except God Almighty that formed and which he was taken. So He drove out the man; and He placed cherubim at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life\" Genesis 3 vs. 23-24\r\n\r\nThe man started running hither and thither looking for solutions. Life became difficult and unbearable. Nakedness means lack. What the man used to enjoy freely now became essential commodities. Before any man can acquire anything in life, he has to suffer before getting it. What a pathetic and difficult life! The man became a needy person. The glory and nature of God departed from him because of the sin committed.\r\n\r\n\"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God\". Romans 3 vs.23\r\n\r\nEven Adam confirmed that he was naked. The nakedness affected both his spiritual and physical being. When God called him, he said, \'when I heard your voice, I was afraid and naked\'. This implies that, he felt the glory of upon his life and when the glory departed he actually knew.\r\n\r\n\"And the LORD GOD called unto Adam, and said unto him, where art thou? And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself\". Genesis 3vs. 9-10\r\n\r\nWhen a man commits sin and his life becomes empty and miserable, that is when he appreciates what he used to enjoy in God before sin. Adam and Eve knew what they were enjoying in God. When sin came into their lives, God\'s glory left them; fear and nakedness replaced it. The resultant curse God placed upon the man has no respect for any of his offspring. Every man born of a woman must suffer from this curse. It\'s the nakedness of Adam and Eve that gave birth to us being needy today. Whatever you desire to have and you cannot get easily makes you naked. If you are the richest man in the whole world and you lack something, no matter how small it may be, you are a naked person; which means you are needy. Check your life and list all your needs and you will realize that you are a needy man or woman. You and I are not born to be \'Mr. and Mrs. Have-all\', but needy persons. I pray that God Almighty will meet us at the point of our needs today in the name of Jesus. And every need that stands as an insurmountable mountain before us shall be destroyed in Jesus name (Amen). The needs of man are overwhelmingly numerous, but as you are reading this book God will meet you at the point of your needs.\r\n\r\nTHE NEEDS OF MAN\r\n\r\nAs I have said earlier, the needs of man are numerous in nature. It\'s not possible for man to get all he needs for the day, let alone a week or more. The needs of two individuals cannot be the same. The need of Mr. A is different from the need of Mr. B. Some might need children while the need of others might be something different. What I need might sound ridiculous to others, but a need is a need no matter the circumstance. Every man has one need or the other to meet the diverse challenges he\'s facing. any\r\n\r\nDespite what Adam and Eve did to God, by disappointing Him through sin, God still met their immediate needs. Your needs shall be met in Jesus name. (Amen). \"Also for Adam and his wife the LORD God made tunics of skin, and clothed them. \"Genesis 3 vs.21\r\n\r\nWhoever that departs from God is naked and no one can cover such nakedness except the living God that created man in His own image. In the actual fact, you cannot compare the skin of an animal to God\'s glory that originally covered the man. I want you to study your life, since you have been doing it on your own without the support of God, have you been able to meet your needs? Of course it\'s impossible.\r\n\r\n\"And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits. Daniel 11 vs.32\r\n\r\nThe Scripture says, if you know your God, you will do great exploits. My dear friend, you need God in your life. Adam and Eve lacked God and their lives became miserable to them and they could not meet their needs.', 'MAN IN NEED OF GOD\r\n\r\nSince sin has separated the man from God, he has been running here and there looking for what will be like God; but all his efforts have proved abortive. The number one need of man is God, our creator. And why do we need God? We need God because He is our creator and the master plan of our lives is in His hands\r\n\r\n\"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.\" Genesis 1 vs. 27\r\n\r\nNo matter how rich you may be, if you don\'t have God, you don\'t have anything. You are a needy and wretched person.\r\n\r\n\"And the LORD GOD called unto Adam, and said unto him, where art thou? And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself\". Genesis 3 vs. 9-10\r\n\r\nWhen Adam and Eve lost all the priviledges they were enjoying from their creator, they became fearful and naked. Nothing can be like God to man; because without God man cannot exist. God is indispensable to the survival of man. Everything that man needs is in God and any situation where man lacks God; he is completely a needy man.\r\n\r\nNo one can live on earth without God in his life. The Scripture says that, in God we do everything in life.\r\n\r\n\"For in Him we live and move and have our being, as also some of your own poets have said, \'For we are also His offspring.\' Acts 17 vs. 28\r\n\r\nAll the programmes of man\'s life are in God\'s hands. Who is the man that can live without God on earth? Of course there\'s none. He is the one that can lead man aright; no man can lead himself on the right course without the creator. All the ways of man are full of evil and destructive ends.\r\n\r\n\"There is a way that seems right to a man, But its end is the way of death. Proverbs 16 vs. 25\r\n\r\nWhen Jacob was about to leave Laban to begin his own independent life, he did not know how to go about it, but God that created him led him on the right path to follow.\r\n\r\nBrother or sister that is reading this book, you need God by your side to lead you aright in life. He led Jacob successfully.\r\n\r\n\"And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.. Genesis 31 vs. 6\r\n\r\nThe condition that Laban gave was impossible for any man, but the God of possibilities made it possible with His mighty power.\r\n\r\n\"But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible. \"Matthew 19 vs. 26\r\n\r\nLaban told Jacob that his wage will be the speckled when the cattle bare speckled and ringstraked when the cattle bare ringstraked which was quite difficult, but because he knew the God of his fathers, God gave him a way out.\r\n\r\n\"And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me. If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.\r\n\r\nThus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me. And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled. And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I. And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee. I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.\" Genesis 31 vs.7-13\r\n\r\nNo matter how knowledgeable you are, you need God. Remember that man is limited while God is unlimited and nothing is too hard for Him to do.\r\n\r\n\"Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there anything too hard for me?\"\r\n\r\nJeremiah 32 vs. 27\r\n\r\nIf it had not been God, Abraham and Sarah his wife would not have had anychild in life. But they had God that created and can do all things by their side. God made the impossibility of man to be possible. Are you at the point of shame? Come to God and by simply accepting Jesus as your Lord and Saviour, He will save you and deliver you from that.\r\n\r\n\"For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.\" Jeremiah 29 vs. 11\r\n\r\nDon\'t depend on anybody but God\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmighty that can do all things. God is the same today, tomorrow and forever more. Halleluiah!\r\n\r\n\"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today,\r\n\r\nand forever. Hebrew 13 vs. 8\r\n\r\nCall upon God today, he will answer and accept you. The Bible says, whoever that calls upon God will be saved. You need God; call Him before it is too late.\r\n\r\n\"And it shall come to pass That whoever calls on the name of the LORD Shall be saved.\"\r\n\r\nActs 2 vs. 21\r\n\r\nHannah called upon God in the day of trouble and God answered her. Whatever you desire or pursuit, brethren, call on Him he will answer you.\r\n\r\n\"And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.\r\n\r\nAnd it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth. Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken. And Eli said unto her, How long thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.\r\n\r\nAnd Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD. Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto. Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him. 1 Samuel 1 vs. 11-17\r\n\r\nHannah told God all she was facing and God answered her prayer. I pray that God will answer all your prayer requests in Jesus name. (Amen)\r\n\r\nDavid was another example. Despite the fact that he was a great warrior, he called upon God when he needed to overcome the Philistine (Goliath). He defeated Goliath with the name of God and not by the power of the stone he shot at him. The stone was just a medium of operation.\r\n\r\n\"Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied. This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel. And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD\'s, and he will give you into our hands. And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine. And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.\" 1 Samuel 17 vs.45-49\r\n\r\nImagine David\'s faith and declaration. After that, he took a step of faith against the enemy of Israel and overcame him. The giant that stood against Israel fell! If you can take a step like David, I pray the giant of your life will fall in Jesus mighty name. Amen.\r\n\r\nMy brother or sister that is reading this book, you need God in every area of your life. And because you are in need of God, that is what guarantee you as number one needy. God is indispensable to every human being on earth. We all need God that created and has all things. He is the only one that has all you will ever need in life. Accept Him today as your saviour.\r\n\r\n\"But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: John 1 vs. 12\r\n\r\nIf you give your life to Jesus today, he will accept you and your name will be written in the book of life. You may be asking yourself, how can I give my life to Jesus? Very simple; just accept Him with your heart and confess with your month that Jesus is Lord.\r\n\r\n\"But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Romans 10 vs. 8-10\r\n\r\nScripture says the word of God is very close to you. All you need is to accept and confess Him as your Lord. As you are doing that, God will accept you in Jesus name. (Amen). You need God and He needs you as well.\r\n\r\n\"But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Romans 10 vs. 8-9\r\n\r\nWhoever that confesses Jesus with his mouth shall be accepted by God and he will become a new person in the Lord.\r\n\r\n\"Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold all things are become new. 11\r\n\r\nCorinthians 5 vs. 17\r\n\r\nEverything about you will change to the nature of God. You now belong to God and obtain His mercy.\r\n\r\n\"Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy. 1 Peter 2 vs. 10\r\n\r\nDISCOVER YOUR PURPOSE ON EARTH\r\n\r\nThe Needs for the Needy\r\n\r\nYour being on earth is not by accident but for a special purpose. Before you can discover such path in life you need God.\r\n\r\n\"I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye. Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.. Psalm 32 vs. 8-9\r\n\r\nSupposing Abraham did not follow God, you would not have heard anything about him. But he followed God, who led him accordingly. It was not only Abraham; many enjoyed the leading of God in the scripture. Moses that led the people of Israel out of Egypt to the land of Canaan was another man led by God. He really enjoyed the companionship of God.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemember he said if God would not go with them, they would not go. God led them with a pillar of cloud by the day and pillar of fire at night. What a wonderful journey they had!\r\n\r\n\"And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night: He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people\". Exodus 13 vs. 21-22\r\n\r\nLet also consider King David. Despite being a warrior, he still asked for God\'s leading. It was the leading of God that made him to succeed in life. Before he did anything, he would ask God whether to do it or not.\r\n\r\n\"And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech\'s son, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David. And David inquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all. 1 Samuel 30 vs. 7-8\r\n\r\nSimilarly, it was the leading of God that helped Apostle Paul to succeed in his ministry. God told him how to go about the ministry and where to go for the assignment.\r\n\r\n\"But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother\'s womb, and called me by his grace, To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood: Galatians 1 vs. 15-16\r\n\r\nPaul was successful because he allowed God in his life and ministry. It is one thing to discover the purpose of God for your life and it is another thing to get Him to guide you. If you allow God to guide you in all your undertakings, you will never make any mistake.\r\n\r\nJohn 14 vs. 26 \"But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. John 14 vs. 26\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of things you don\'t know that you need God to teach you and also remind you of things you might have forgotten. Moreover, you need God to comfort you in times of challenges. We are in a world problems.\r\n\r\n\"These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world. John 16 vs. 33 When David was in a serious distress, it was the spirit of God that comforted him. \"So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives. Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.And David\'s two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God. 1 Samuel 30 vs. 3-6\r\n\r\nDavid was distressed but he encouraged himself in the Lord. Fortunately, he had God in his life. You need God in this world of problems; a world you smile in the morning and weep in the afternoon. You need God in every area of your life.', 'COMPANION\r\n\r\n\"And the LORD God said, it is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him. \"Genesis 2 vs. 18 God knew that after Him the next thing that man earnestly needed was a companion. Even God said in His words that, \'it\'s not good that man should be alone\'. If truly you want to achieve your goal in life, you need somebody by your side to help you. In the area of procreation, Adam could not do it alone. He needed Eve to make it achievable. And so God brought Eve out of Adam and made her a helper for him. The vision of God for you cannot get to fulfillment without help from other men or women to make it possible. It is true that Christ came to save mankind from their sins, but He Appointed people that would work with Him in order to accomplish this mission.\r\n\r\n\"And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease. Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus; Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, cannot get to fulfillment without help from other men or women to make it possible. It is true that Christ came to save mankind from their sins, but He Appointed people that would work with Him in order to accomplish this mission.\r\n\r\n\"And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease. Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus; Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not: But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give. Matthew 10 vs. 1-8\r\n\r\nJesus knew He could not do the work alone; for this reason, He needed to call people around Him to help in fulfilling the assignment. For instance, He could not be in two places at the same time. Although He was God in man, yet He put on the human nature. Therefore, He appointed twelve Disciples. So, the assignment successful because He had enough people, You need people to help you reach your goal in life. Isolation is a friend of suicide. Don\'t isolate your glory or vision; but look for people that have the same mind like you. People of positive influence that share your vision.\r\n\r\n\"Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up. Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone? And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken. Eccl. 4 vs. 9-12\r\n\r\nWhen I started my ministry, my wife was the first person that supported me. The first Sunday service was held in our sitting room. And it was just me and her. I was the pastor and she was the member. After that Sunday, people began to join us and added their own contributions to the growth of the ministry. To God be the glory, \"Halleluyah\" that made the journey possible.. Two are better than one. In a situation where you are confused about a matter, your partner will bring a suggestion for a way out.\r\n\r\nAny ministry or organization that desires fulfillment must not play with what is called \'team work\'. In a management meeting of any organization, the various departments of it share views and opinions together in order to move the organization forward. A brilliant idea that a director of a company does not have, for example, could be suggested by a worker for the growth of the company. When I started my \'God-given\' ministry, it was one of our brethren that gave me the idea of contributing a small amount of money every month to gain financial strength to promote the ministry. And to the glory of God, the idea helped the ministry to grow financially. Assuming Naaman failed to allow team work, he would have remained a leper. It was one of his servants that told him to go to Samaria for his healing.\r\n\r\n\"Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was a leper. And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman\'s wife. And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy.11 Kings 5 vs. 1-3\r\n\r\nThe servant told Naaman that there was a prophet in Samaria that could cure his leprosy. And to the glory of God, on getting there, the man of God set him free from the disease in the name of the God of Israel that settled on River Jordan. Don\'t also forget that it was David that delivered King Saul from the Philistine that stood against them.\r\n\r\n\"And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.And David said to Saul, Let no man\'s heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.. 1 Samuel 17 vs. 31-32\r\n\r\nDavid went and faced the Philistine that stood against them and he overcame him in the name of the God of Israel. Brethren, you need a man to help you interpret your vision and bring it to fulfillment. If you don\'t have a good man or woman beside you to give you a helping hand, you are a needy person. I pray that God will give you the right person that will help you to fulfill your purpose in life in Jesus name. Sisters and brothers that are waiting upon God for marital partners, I pray that God will give you the right husband and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'SPECIAL GRACE\r\n\r\nGrace is a gift of God that is indispensable to a man\'s life. No one can do without it. \"For by grace you have been saved through\r\n\r\nfaith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift\r\n\r\nof God\" Ephesians 2 vs. 8\r\n\r\nYour salvation is by the grace of God, had been for salvation of Christ. It was grace that Noah received that made him to escape the wrath of God.\r\n\r\n\"But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.\" Genesis 6 vs.8\r\n\r\nWe were not told that it was work or righteousness that saved him, but grace. Grace helps you to achieve what you don\'t qualify for in life. You cannot go to any market to buy grace, but you can get the special grace of God through our Lord Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\nThe word said, you are saved by grace. Imagine that. Personally, I am not qualified for the level I find myself in the Lord today, but the special grace of God qualified me. I want you to ask yourself this question. \"The level or position I am occupying at the moment, am I qualified for it or not?\" If your answer is no, it means it is God\'s grace that made you qualify. And again, you cannot say I want grace but I don\'t want God. He is the owner of grace. You need God in order to have His grace in your life.\r\n\r\nIt was this special grace that made God chose Moses to lead the people of Israel from Egypt to the Promised Land.\r\n\r\n\"And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy. Exodus 33 vs. 19\r\n\r\nJust imagine Moses that told God he was a stammerer and that He should send Aaron, his elder brother instead of him. But God insisted on Moses. It was the special grace that made him to qualify for the assignment. Also consider Esther in a strange land; no father nor mother that could help her out. Even though she did not occupy any notable post, but she had God of Israel that had everything\r\n\r\nNow when the turn came for Esther the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her as his daughter, to go in to the king, she requested nothing but what Hegai the king\'s eunuch, the custodian of the women, advised. And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all who saw her. Esther 2 vs. 15\r\n\r\nThe grace of God made Esther the next queen in a land that did not belong to her or her parents.\r\n\r\n\"So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti. Esther 2 vs. 16-17\r\n\r\nThank God Esther recognized the God of Israel and she was not disappointed. No one knows God and gets disappointed. Knowing God will make you to achieve what a natural man cannot achieve in life. Were it not for the grace of God upon Apostle Paul, he would not have got to the level he attained in life\r\n\r\n\"By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name: Romans 1 vs.5\r\n\r\nThe Disciples had grace of God upon their lives. However, Apostle Paul had greater grace which singled him out among other Apostles. What ordinary human being cannot do, they easily.\r\n\r\n\"And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all. Acts 4 vs.33\r\n\r\nAnd great grace was upon them all. Outstanding miracles happened through them. Just the shadow of Apostle Peter that healed the sick. Even his first message won three thousand souls at a time. It was the great grace of God that was upon Apostle Peter that made this possible. Don\'t forget the apron of Apostle Paul healed the sick and the people that were being tormented by evil spirits, received deliverance as the word of God came out of Paul\'s mouth.\r\n\r\n', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '0000-00-00', '');

The journey of life began from God at creation. And the Bible makes us to understand that, God created us in His image and likeness.\r\n\r\n\"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth earth. \"Genesis 1:26-28. upon the\r\n\r\nThe plan of God for mankind was great and unique. God wanted man to live successfully in every area of life, as in the heavenly kingdom.\r\n\r\n\"And he said unto them, when ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth. \"Luke 11:2\r\n\r\nEverything was made to make the lives of mankind better and meaningful.\r\n\r\n\"For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end\"Jeremiah 29:11.\r\n\r\nIt was not God\'s plan for man to suffer, but to enjoy His blessings on earth. But it was quite unfortunate for mankind, that the devil came in and changed the plans of God through the power of sin. \"For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.\" Romans 3:23.\r\n\r\nimmediately sin came to man\'s life, every privilege hitherto enjoyed ceased and every trait of God departed from man. Man became needy and wretched. The principal assignment of sin was to destroy man and turn them to beggars. Everything was at the disposal of man in the Garden of Eden. But the moment sin came in, man got driven away from the garden to the world of problems.\r\n\r\n\"Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life. \"Genesis 3:23-24\r\n\r\nBefore man got sent away from the Garden of Eden, they were operating comfortably in the supernatural realm of God. Regrettably, Satan stripped man of the supernatural virtue through sin and they automatically became natural beings. And being in the natural form, invariably made things that were relatively easy for man before to become very difficult.\r\n\r\nUnder this sad and deplorable situation, man began to look for a solution. And so they started moving from pillar to post; but every effort for a way out was fruitless. Man that operated and lived the way that pleased God and according to His plan, was suddenly limited to natural capabilities, as the supernatural grace he was enjoying was removed. No one can glory in the flesh, but only in the Lord.\r\n\r\n\"For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do. \"Romans 7:19\r\n\r\nThere was a time I met somebody who was encountering certain challenges in his job. He was a very good professional, but things became very hard for him to the extent that he was finding it difficult to take care of his family, among other responsibilities. He claimed he did all he could to improve the situation, but all was to no avail. And I told him that a natural man cannot succeed, except he has the support of God in his undertaking.\r\n\r\nAdam and Eve that were in relative comfort and knew no problem, now began to suffer before meeting their daily needs. The power of nature that they were now being subjected to, took its toll on them and eroded all their supernatural privileges away and everything turned upside down for them.\r\n\r\nEvery race of life is full of problems. And the only way man can be free is to recognize and allow the divine presence in all their ways.', 'LIFE EXPERIENCE WITHOUT GOD\r\n\r\n\"I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. \"Philippians 4:13 There is no one on earth without one experience or the other, either small or big.\r\n\r\nWhen Joseph took his father to Pharaoh\'s palace, the king asked Jacob what he had gone through in life. And Jacob replied and told him all that he has experienced.\r\n\r\n\"And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou? And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage. \"Genesis 47:8-9\r\n\r\nBefore Jacob could locate the God of his fathers, he had used his natural knowledge to get things done to succeed. But all his efforts did not yield any positive result until he encountered the God of his fathers.\r\n\r\n\"For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?\"Genesis 30:30\r\n\r\nCan you imagine Jacob to have served his father-in- law for good twenty years without any good thing happening in his life, except wives and children that he had?\r\n\r\nIt was God that gave him a spiritual solution to his problem in the dream. There is nothing you can do successfully without God, your Creator.\r\n\r\nI could recall when I was using my personal knowledge to pave the way for myself to succeed. I failed woefully beyond what I could imagine, until I came back to God for a way out. What followed my decision were countless number of testimonies that I experienced.\r\n\r\n\"But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible. \"Matthew 19:26\r\n\r\nThere is a common saying by some Christians that, \'life without Christ is crisis.\' Of course, yes, they are right. I used to know a man that devised various means and used all he had to succeed at all cost, without God. It was therefore not a surprise that his ignorance cost him many years of struggling to make it, with nothing to show for his toils. Fortunately for him, he met someone who told him that he needed to locate God, his Creator, before he would make it. In the end, he gave his life to Jesus and was filled with the power of the Holy Spirit. And to the glory of God, he later became great as God led him to the right way to succeed.\r\n\r\nEven the Apostles of Christ thought they could do it\r\n\r\nwithout His support. Apostle Peter was the leader of a team of fishermen\r\n\r\nthat went out fishing. But they were not able to catch any fish until Jesus got to the place and told them to launch their net to the right place.\r\n\r\n\"There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples. Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing. But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus. Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No. And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.\"John 21:2-6\r\n\r\nI was also told about a man that used his power to build a house for sixteen years and could not finish it. But when he allowed God to lead him, he used just few months to build another house and finished it. The natural power or strength leads to doom, while God leads you to a solution. Every human being has one experience or the other. But to succeed, we need God in our lives.', 'THE UNLIMITED\r\n\r\nMan is limited in nature but God, the Creator of heaven and earth is unlimited in every area. When God was sending Moses to Pharaoh, he asked God a question hat, \"if the people should ask me about you, what hould I tell them?\" And God simply replied, tell them \"I AM that I AM. \"What this means is that, God is everything. \r\n\r\n\"And God said unto Moses, IAM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. \"Exodus 3:14\r\n\r\nMany have tried to be in the position of God on earth but death took them away. God has been existing before creation and shall remain God, even after the\r\n\r\nend of this world. Abraham and his wife had lost hope of bearing a child because they were natural persons. But our God that is unlimited, made what could not happen naturally to happen in their lives.\r\n\r\n\"And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him. Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old? Is anything too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son. \"Genesis 18:9-14\r\n\r\n\"And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken. For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac. \"Genesis 21:1-3\r\n\r\nJust imagine the power of the unlimited God in the family of Abraham. God here proved beyond any reasonable doubt, that where man\'s limitation ends, is where the unlimited God begins His own work. Nothing you can compare with God\'s power. The book of Isaiah makes us to understand that the understanding of God is unsearchable.\r\n\r\n\"Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding. \"Isaiah 40:28\r\n\r\nGod understands every situation both in heaven and on earth. He gives power to those who do not have power and strength to the fainted. When I did a little study about God, I came to a conclusion about Him that He\'s \"All in All.\"Whatever situation you can think of you will see God there giving solutions to cases. God is very great.\r\n\r\nNebuchadnezzar had a dream and could not remember it, let alone knowing the meaning. The king asked all his magicians to tell him the dream he had and then interpret it. But to the king\'s surprise and disappointment, they could not. But Daniel acknowledged the God of Israel that was unlimited in all cases, in prayer.\r\n\r\nAnd God revealed both the dream and its interpretation to him.\r\n\r\n\"Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his: And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding: He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him. I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king\'s matter. \"Daniel 2:19-23.\r\n\r\nIt\'s only the unlimited God that can do that. When Daniel saw what God did, he began to exalt Him. Let us also look at the three young Hebrews that King Nebuchadnezzar ordered to be put in a great fire. God turned the fire to a good and pleasant place for them and He even joined them there.\r\n\r\nThe mighty men of the king that cast the three Hebrews into the fire got killed by just the heat of the same fire. What a great God that is unlimited!\r\n\r\n\"Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, came forth of the midst of the fire. \"Daniel 3:26.\r\n\r\nNebuchadnezzar was greatly amazed that he confessed that, there was no other god like the God of the Hebrews.\r\n\r\nThe birth of our Lord Jesus was quite a wonderful phenomenon. How could a woman conceive without having a sexual relationship with a man?\r\n\r\n\"And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: And he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.\r\n\r\nThen said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?\"Luke 1:31-34\r\n\r\nNo scientist or any person on earth, no matter the knowledge or skills, can do what God did through Mary, the mother of Jesus. Mary conceived and had a baby called Jesus, the Saviour.\r\n\r\nWhere the knowledge, understanding and power of man fail, is where the strength, wisdom, omniscience power of the unlimited God always provides a solution to every problem or situation of the natural man.\r\n\r\nMan is the limited, while God, the Creator of heaven and earth is the unlimited. Everyone that wants to succeed in life needs God that is unlimited. God will help us in Jesus\' Name. Amen', 'Chapter Four\r\n-----------------------\r\nTRANSFORMATION OF LIFE\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of man in the Garden of Eden, everything turned upside down for them. God created man perfectly, but sin came and polluted every plan of God for their lives. But thank God that made a perfect way for man to be free from sin and natural life.me\r\n\r\n\"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. \"John 3:16\r\n\r\nIt was the immeasurable love of God for man that brought a great transformation to mankind. Christ laid down His life as a sacrifice for you and me to be free from Satan, sin and the natural life that cannot please God. \"But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. \"Romans 5:8 The death and resurrection of Christ brought hope and\r\n\r\na new life for mankind. \"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus. \"Philippians 2:5\r\n\r\nMiraculously, the heart of man changed from its natural state and became supernatural, without undergoing any medical surgery of the world. It was the sacrificial life of Jesus that gave man this transformation of life.\r\n\r\nThere is no one\'s life that the death and resurrection of Christ cannot transform, provided such a person confesses and accepts Jesus into his or her life.\r\n\r\n\"But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name. \"John 1:12\r\n\r\nWhoever that gives his or her life to Jesus shall be saved; be it a messenger, servant, king or even president of a nation.\r\n\r\n\"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. \"1 John 3:1-2\r\n\r\nIt is a great privilege to be called the son or daughter of the Most High God. Don\'t forget that, we were once sinners that could not move close to God\'s throne. But the grace of salvation saved you and me and made this possible.\r\n\r\nImmediately you accept Jesus into your life, your natural heart will change to a regenerated mind of Christ.\r\n\r\n\"For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the 1850 100 2900 mind of Christ.\"1 Corinthians 2:16\r\n\r\nPaul the Apostle made us to understand that, they possessed the mind of God that was instructing them to do the right thing at the right time. The journey of life outside Christ is crisis. You and I need Christ for us to succeed in life. The first Apostles of Jesus received the regenerated mind of Christ and had their lives greatly transformed. No wonder they succeeded in all their undertakings.\r\n\r\n\"Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus. And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could nothing against it. \"Acts 4:13-14 say\r\n\r\nA number of miracles happened through the first Apostles, to the extent that people of their time could bear testimonies of these. Everything worked out well for them. If you allow the fullness of God in your life, everything concerning you shall experience a great transformation of God.\r\n\r\nGod does not demand for your money or property, but rather your heart.\r\n\r\n\"But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. \"Romans 10:8-9\r\n\r\nAll Christ is asking from you is to confess and accept Him with your heart and your life shall be greatly transformed. \r\n', 'POWER IN THE SUPERNATURAL\r\n\r\nLife in the natural state cannot be compared with that in the supernatural. In other words, life spent without God cannot attract a good result, but frustration and failure.\r\n\r\nWith the years that Jacob spent in Laban\'s house, there was nothing to show for it, until when God of his fathers showed him the way out.\r\n\r\n\"And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake. And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it. And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me. For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also? \"Genesis 30: 27-30.\r\n\r\nJacob was totally frustrated in Laban\'s house without any financial or material success, expect wives and children that he had.\r\n\r\nLaban gave him conditions that, naturally speaking, he could not have fulfilled.\r\n\r\n\"And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock: I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire. \"Genesis 30:31-32\r\n\r\nJacob remembered the God of his fathers and had a great encounter with Him in the dream. What man could not do naturally, happened in the life of Jacob. \r\n\r\n\"And he set three days\' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban\'s flocks. And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods. And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink. And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle rings traked, speckled, and spotted. And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the rings traked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban\'s cattle. And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods. But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban\'s, and the stronger Jacob\'s. And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses. \"Genesis 30:36-43\r\n\r\nJacob that had nothing before, became greater than Laban in blessings, because he had the full support of God.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing man can do successfully in the flesh that can guarantee the peace of God. You need God by your side to keep you going in the journey of life.\r\n\r\nJacob would have ended his journey in Laban\'s house without making any progress in life. Maybe you too must have done one thing or the other in order to make it in life, but has nothing to show for it yet; all that you need is God by your side to direct and lead you.\r\n\r\n\"I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye. Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee. \"Psalm 32:8-9\r\n\r\nPeter was a great fisher man. And one day, he and his team of fishermen needed fish for survival as usual. On getting to the river, they tried all they could to get fish, but all their attempts yielded nothing. They became frustrated and had even given up until Jesus came in and told them where to get fish.\r\n\r\n\"Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing. But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus. Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No. And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes. \"John 21:3-6\r\n\r\nOver that job or business that you are doing that doesn\'t give you a desired result, there is a way out, only if you allow God to direct your path. Consider what happened to Peter and his colleagues. With their professional experience, they used all the fishing tactics known to them and yet, they could not get a single fish. But the moment Jesus got to the place, the story changed. If you allow God in your life, I pray that your story will change in Jesus\' Name. Amen.\r\n\r\nMan will always be limited in all ways, but any one that carries the fullness of God will become unlimited, as God is unlimited in nature. Before our Lord Jesus started His assignment on earth, even though He was God in human flesh, yet He received the unction to function. He was fully empowered spiritually before He started His ministry on earth.\r\n\r\n\"And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about. \"Luke 4:14\r\n\r\nWhen Jesus was about to ascend to heaven, He told His Disciples to go to Jerusalem and pray for power before doing anything. This was necessary because they would not succeed in the assignment of the Gospel, using the natural way, except they became endowed with power.\r\n\r\nAnd when the power came, what a natural man could not do, happened through the Apostles. Peter that was a great coward before now, became a mighty man before the people that were more than five thousand. He boldly addressed them with the Word of God and over three thousand gave their lives to Jesus. What a great power of God!\r\n\r\n\"And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven. Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language. And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans? \"Acts 2:1-7\r\n\r\n\"Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation. Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. \"Acts 2:38-41\r\n\r\nNo one is born with power, but everyone that has accepted Jesus into his or her life must strive to get it. Our Lord Jesus was in the wilderness for good forty days and nights without food or water. He was praying for power and at last he was empowered.\r\n\r\nChrist Disciples also were in the upper room for several days, praying for the endowment of power. And when the power eventually came upon them, they all became supernatural persons.\r\n\r\nIf the power of God is upon your life, where your natural ability or power stops, is where the supernatural will commence actions and command a good result with ease. \r\n\r\nBut Jesus beneld them, and said unto them, With wen this is impossible; but with God all things are ossible. Matthew 19:26\r\n\r\nChanging a job or business to another is neither a solution nor a guarantee for your success. What you need is the power of God. You need to be empowered before you can command and get the desired result.\r\n\r\nA supernatural life is a solution carrier anytime, any day. Our father in the Lord, Apostle Ayodele Babalola acquired the power of God when he was alive. Consequently, a great revival and a lot of miracles happened through him in 1930. You and I need the power of the Holy Ghost before we can succeed in anything on earth.', 'DIVINE DIRECTION\r\n\r\nThe role of power is different from that of a divine direction. The journey of life will be smoother, if only we can discover the direction of God for our lives.\r\n\r\n\"I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye. Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee. \"Psalm 32:8-9\r\n\r\nThe psalmist here says, you shall be instructed and taught on how to make your life successful. You don\'t just take up a job or business and be doing it without discovering the ways of God for your life.\r\n\r\n\"Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the wombl sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations. Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child. But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child; for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak. Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the LORD. Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth. See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant. Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree. \"Jeremiah 1:5-11\r\n\r\nGod had already made Jeremiah a prophet before he got to this earth. Your age has nothing to do with what God has for your life. Jeremiah was a small boy when he discovered the direction of God for his life. Many are expecting God to perform a miracle over the job or business that God did not ask them to do. No miracle can happen in such a way except what you are doing is supported by God\'s direction.\r\n\r\n\"Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No. And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes. \"John 21:5-6\r\n\r\nIf Jesus had not given them the right direction, they would have gone back empty handed. If anyone is claiming to be using the supernatural power of God, but in a wrong place or location, it will amount to nothing but failure and impossibility.\r\n\r\nSome however discovered the divine direction for their lives, but lack the power of God for the assignment. Formal knowledge is good, if the power of God is included in the assignment or undertaking; as formal knowledge alone cannot take you anywhere without the support of God\'s power. We need to go to God in prayer for a divine direction.\r\n\r\n\"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. \"Matthew 7:7\r\n\r\n\"And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full. \"John 16:23-24\r\n\r\nThe grace is there for us to ask our Father what we need. God is always in the prayer room, but looking for someone that can pray like Elijah.\r\n\r\n\"Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not Train: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months. And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit. \"James 5:17-18\r\n\r\nEvery believer that is yet to discover the divin direction of God for his or her life, needs to engage in an effective prayer and stop the trial and error attempts to succeed.\r\n\r\nBrother or sister reading this book, I want you to evaluate your ways. Have you discovered the divine direction for your life? If your answer is \"Yes\", I congratulate you. But if it is \"No\", then what are you waiting for? Engage in a serious prayer and talk to your Creator to show you the way before it is too late.\r\n\r\nI pray, the grace and power to discover the ways of God for your life will come upon you in Jesus\' Name. Once you discover the divine direction for your life, don\'t joke with it. Grab it firmly, and I can assure you it will turn your life around.\r\n\r\nThe power of God, coupled with the right direction will guarantee a good result and uncommon testimony. It is good to succeed on earth and get to the Kingdom of God at the end of this life. If you have not given your life to Jesus, this is an opportunity for you to accept Him.\r\n\r\n\"For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" John 3:16\r\n\r\nGod loves you and He doesn\'t want you to perish. And that is the more reason Christ died on the Cross of Calvary for your sin.\r\n\r\n\"But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for\r\n\r\nwus. \"Romans 5:8\r\n\r\nGive your life to Jesus today and your name shall be written in the book of life and you shall become the son or daughter of God.\r\n\r\n\"But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: \"John 1:12\r\n\r\nConfess Jesus with your mouth and accept Him with your heart.\r\n\r\n\"That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. \"Romans 10:9\r\n\r\nGod loves you. I pray God will bless you in all way sin Jesus\' Name. Amen.', '', '', '', '', 'ziggyadex@gmail.com', '2023-04-18', '');

It is not only members of the church that are ignorant of Godâ€™s messages, but some so-called ministers of the Gospel also lack adequate knowledge about divine instruction.\r\nâ€œI will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye. Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.â€ Psalm 32:8-9\r\nHowever, some understand and recognize a divine instruction, but if the message does not suit their purpose or personal interest, they will ignore it and still expect the church to experience divine presence of the Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\nMany do not even know what the call of God is all about; what is expected of a servant in the house of God, as well as the mystery of the kingdom expansion.\r\nHaving the full understanding of these in the house of God, will make you a complete Christian. \r\nOur God is full of knowledge and His understanding is unsearchable.\r\nâ€œTalk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.â€ I Samuel 2:3. â€œHast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding. He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.â€ Isaiah 40:28-29.\r\nGod expects you and I to have the full knowledge about the kingdom matters. Whoever lacks the full knowledge of God will automatically be a prey to the kingdom of Satan.\r\nAdequate knowledge and full understanding about the things of God will make you an outstanding person in the Lord, and the entire world will see the glory of God upon your life. \r\nThis book will, no doubt, help you to go deep in the knowledge of God. I pray that as you read, the Holy Spirit will help you to receive the inspiration and revelation of the Word in Jesusâ€™ Mighty Name.', 'ABOUT THE BOOK\r\nThis book is aimed at unfolding the mystery of divine instruction and how to understand it, as many Christians today lack its understanding.\r\nâ€œMy people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.â€ Hosea 4:6\r\nBelievers are dying because they lack the spiritual knowledge that would have helped them to overcome the manipulations of the devil. This book will set you free from the tricks of the devil, inspire and open your understanding as you read.', 'DIVINE INSTRUCTION\r\nGod is the all in all â€“ the Supreme Being. He has the final say in the affairs of man on earth. But in some cases, man find it difficult to trust God for everything. Remember that man can only have an idea, but God has the direction to all things in life. Even the idea that man has, usually leads to failure and disappointment, while Godâ€™s direction leads to blessings and fulfillment.\r\nâ€œBut Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.â€ Matthew 19:26\r\nApostle Peter was a great, skillful and experienced fisher man. He knew everything about fishing. But there was a night when his knowledge and experience of fishing failed to give him his desired. He could not catch a fish as all his efforts all night were in vain.\r\n After Jesus finished preaching using Peterâ€™s boat, He told him to launch his net into the ocean. Consequently, he caught many fishes, which he could not catch all night. \r\nNormally every experienced fisherman comes out to fish in the night, because fish would not come out in the afternoon. But due to the divine instruction from Jesus Christ, Simon Peter, the great fisher man obeyed and received the reward of obedience.\r\nâ€œNow when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught. And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net. And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake. And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink. When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus\' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.â€ Luke 5:4-8\r\nMany lives have turned upside down today because they find it difficult to obey the instruction of God.\r\nThere was a time I needed God to show mercy onto me; so I went into three daysâ€™ fasting and prayer. After the prayer, God told me to show mercy to a woman that could not buy the school uniform for her son. And to my surprise, the money I had with me at that time was the exact amount of money the woman needed. I obeyed God, even though I needed some money to solve my own challenge. After obeying this divine instruction, someone gave me a phone call and said God told her to give me some money; and surprisingly, the actual amount of money that I needed.\r\nâ€œFor God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saintsâ€. I Corinthians 14:33\r\nBrethren, God knows and has the best. Even the mother of Jesus knew the kind of child she had; as she told His Disciples that, whatever He instructed them to do, they should obey.\r\nâ€œHis mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.â€ John 2:5\r\nAt the wedding in Canaan, Jesus was told that the wine had finished. The Disciples thought Jesus would instruct them to go to a brewery or command heaven to release wine. But Jesus didnâ€™t do that.\r\n The divine instruction he gave was that â€œfetch water inside the potâ€¦â€ And His Disciples obeyed and what followed, without Jesus praying on the water, was an instant miracle!\r\nâ€œAnd there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it. When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.â€ John 2:6-10\r\nObeying a divine instruction makes oneâ€™s journey in life stress-free with unimaginable miracles and testimonies. \r\nAnother good example of someone who received a divine instruction in the Bible was the wife of the prophet, through Prophet Elisha in the book of second kings. â€œNow there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen. And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil. Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few. And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full. So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out. And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed. Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest.â€ 2 kings 4:1-7\r\nThe woman told Prophet Elisha about the debt her husband owed before he died. Obviously, she needed the financial assistance of the man of God. But instead of this, the prophet gave an instruction that provided a solution to her case. Thank God she obeyed and received an instant miracle.\r\nPeople in the world and even some in the house of God see a divine instruction as being impossible and foolish to obey.\r\nOne thing I know is that, blessed are they that obey a divine instruction.\r\n\r\nOBSTACLES TO DIVINE INSTRUCTION\r\nThere are lots of things that the devil is using to hinder man to obey the instruction of God.\r\n1.	Carnal mind: The Bible says; â€œFor they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God. But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of hisâ€. Romans 8:5-9.\r\nNo one can serve God in flesh and obey the message of God.\r\n2.	Lack of faith: It is not everyone in the house of God that has faith in God.\r\nâ€œFor we walk by faith, not by sight:â€ 2 Corinthians 5:7\r\nâ€œBut without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek himâ€. Hebrews 11:6\r\n3.	Scientific or personal belief: Many people that are called atheists and some certain scientists do not believe in the existence God.\r\n4.	Self-confidence: You only know what you are capable of doing; but you donâ€™t know what can happen through God.\r\n5.	Lack of knowledge of God. \r\nâ€œAh Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee:â€ Jeremiah 32:27\r\n6.	Religion: Many in the house of God are obstacles towards Godâ€™s miracle or instruction.\r\n7.	A wrong doctrine which the Bible calls heresy: When fake pastors feed the sheep with wrong messages, they will find it difficult to obey divine instructions.\r\nFrom these points mentioned above, which one is Satan using to distract you from the things of God?\r\n â€œIn whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.â€ 2 Corinthians 4:4.\r\nI pray God will deliver you in Jesusâ€™ Name. God loves you and He doesnâ€™t want you to perish. Accept Him into your life and you shall be guided with a divine instruction.\r\n    \r\n                                                        \r\nâ€¢	THE MYSTERY OF DIVINE INSTRUCTION\r\nThe Scripture makes us to understand that, the thought of God is far different from the thought of man. Man reason naturally, while God operates supernaturally. And the difference between the two is very wide beyond the understanding of man.\r\nâ€œFor my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD.  For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater: So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.â€ Isaiah 55:8-11\r\n\r\nIt was God that led the people of Israel out of Egypt to the Promised Land. There was a road that they would have passed to the Promised Land without any stress. (Road through the Philistines). But God did not lead them through that way.\r\nâ€œAnd it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:â€ Exodus 13:17\r\n\r\nGod told them to go through the Red sea where there was there was no road. Is that not mysterious?\r\n\r\nâ€œIs not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness. And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will show to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever. The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace. And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward: But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea. And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honor upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them: And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night. And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.\" Exodus 14:12-22.\r\n\r\nWhat an instruction given to natural man to obey! You are seeing what can destroy you on the way and someone tells you to feel free to pass it. Of course, itâ€™s impossible. But since the instruction came from God, Moses and the people of Israel had no alternative than to follow it. Humanly speaking, itâ€™s impossible, but with God all things are possible.\r\nMany believers fail to obey an instruction of God, because it is against the standards of the natural man.\r\n\r\nGod told the woman of God that was in charge of a church to tell all the women that were trusting God for the fruit of the womb to put water in the dew for seven days. And after that, the water should be blessed for them to drink as God had promised to bless them with children through that means.\r\n\r\nThere was a medical practitioner among the women that was believing God for the fruit of the womb too. But she doubted the divine instruction and said; medically, germs would enter the water that would be exposed to the dew for seven days. She did not put the water in the dew as they were instructed, let alone drink it. She failed to do what others did, for the fear of getting infected by germs.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, other women obeyed the instruction and they all conceived afterwards. After four to five months, the medical woman saw the wonders of God in the lives of those women that obeyed the divine instruction; and she ran to the woman of God so as to conceive like them. \r\n\r\nAnd you know that we are serving a merciful God. She followed the same process and drank the water exposed to the dew this time, and God answered her prayer and she too conceived. What a mysterious God!\r\n\r\nThe word â€˜mysteryâ€™ is something beyond the natural level and could be very hard to follow and believe.\r\n\r\nThe time I was believing God for my house, God kept on telling me that He had already built a house for me. And I told God that I did not have money to build a house; but the Spirit of God told me that what I had then could build a house. And you know to build a befitting house you must have millions of naira. But for me, I had a ridiculous amount of money in my bank account.\r\n\r\nBut to the glory of God, I took a bold step of faith and started the construction. And as I commenced building, God inspired people to render good financial help; and under three months, the house was ready.\r\n\r\nThat also reminds me of the construction of our first church building. The only amount of money in the church purse then was just eleven thousand naira. And to the glory of God, God built a mega building worth between fifteen to twenty million naira for us under a year!\r\n\r\nThere are a number of living testimonies that have been recorded through simple obedience to divine instructions.\r\n\r\nWHY DIVINE INSTRUCTION?\r\nItâ€™s a big question that someone once asked, that why doesnâ€™t God operate or give an instruction that can easily be understood or acceptable by the natural man?\r\nOur God has reasons for everything He does. The following are the attributes of divine instruction:\r\nI.	Itâ€™s ever true: There is no element of falsehood in any instruction that comes from God. Even the Scripture makes us to understand that, we shall know the truth and it will set us free from every manipulation of the devil.\r\nâ€œAnd ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.â€ John 8:32. The Word of God is pure and ever true. It does not change; itâ€™s consistently true.\r\nII.	Itâ€™s godly: Any divine Instruction carries Godâ€™s presence. It carries the fullness of the Almighty God. The life of God is in the Word and it cannot fail. â€œIt is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.â€ John 6:63.\r\n\r\nIII.	Itâ€™s Powerful: A lot of words had been spoken that had no power, let alone manifesting. But the instruction of God is full of power, which is like a two edged sword â€“ having both positive and negative power.\r\nâ€œFor the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.â€ Hebrews 4:12. \r\nIV.	It glorifies God: Wherever the Word or instruction of God is being delivered and comes to pass, people around witness and glorify God for its fulfillment. Of course, in a situation where God sends a message to you through His prophet and it comes to pass, you will glorify the Name of God.\r\nV.	Itâ€™s effective: The Word of God is very effective in nature. If the instruction has not been delivered or uttered, nothing happens; but as soon as the word goes out, actions follow it immediately. What happened between Peter and Ananias is a good example. Actions took place immediately.\r\nâ€œBut a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession; And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles\' feet. But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land? Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God. And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things.â€ Acts 5:1-5\r\nWhat happened to Ananias also happened to his wife within few minutes. God is great!\r\nVI.	It commands testimonies: Every divine instruction commands testimonies easily. There is no one that follows a divine instruction without testifying.\r\nâ€œThe law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.â€ Psalm 19:7\r\nVII.	It draws people closer to God: The Bible says; without signs and wonders, people may find it difficult to believe. Divine instructions attract more people to God and make them to believe that the living God is real.\r\n\r\nâ€¢	GRIEVE NOT THE HOLY SPIRIT\r\nMany believers and unbelievers had grieved the Holy Spirit in many areas. Many Christians would have long succeeded, but they find it difficult to follow the instruction of the Holy Spirit. Some find it difficult to follow Godâ€™s instruction because of the high level they claim they have attained in the Lord. While some on the other hand, use their life experiences to analyze every message that comes from God.\r\nâ€œWherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men. And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.â€ Matthew 12:31-32   \r\nThe Scripture makes us to understand that, sin to God the Son can be forgiven but every sin against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. Both ministers of the Gospel and some so-called Christians are working against the divine instruction of God in the church. No wonder darkness has gained the upper hand against many churches today; because we are not ready to follow the instruction of God for the church.\r\n\r\nThere was a time they had an indoor revival in a church; and the guest minister told the whole church to pray against being implicated in a matter that they knew nothing about. There was a woman in that revival that refused to join others to offer the prayer. Few days after the programme, the woman left her house for her place of business on a Monday morning. She unknowingly boarded a commercial bus that also had fleeing armed robbers as passengers. When the law enforcements pursuing the armed robbers later overtook the bus and arrested them, they pointed at that woman as their matron!\r\nThis woman was seriously dealt with and could have died in the course of being beaten, but for the grace of God that saved her. She disobeyed the simple instruction of the Holy Spirit.\r\nThere was also a time God instructed me to tell the church to bring their children for a special prayer against the attack of the devil. One woman failed to bring the one and only child of hers to the church. She was at home fighting one of her neighbours when others were in the church praying for their children. And itâ€™s a pity she was the only one that lost her child at the time to disobedience.\r\nPlease people of God; you can play with anything, but not a divine order or instruction from God.\r\nâ€œThen Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the LORD, To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria. Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof â€¦â€œAnd it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria: And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof. And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died.â€ 2 Kings 7:1-2, 18-20.\r\nIn that Bible passage there was a severe famine in the land of Samaria that caused people to be killing their children for food. The king of that city sent a message to Prophet Elisha to help them seek the face of God for a solution. And Prophet Elisha prophesied to the king that by the same time of that day the next day, food would be available in great abundance. The chief captain in the army of that nation doubted and mocked this message of God. And the man of God told him that, he would only see the wonder, but would not taste it. And that was it! The chief captain actually saw the abundance of food the following day as prophesied by the man of God, but itâ€™s quite unfortunate he did not eat out of it. He was trampled to death! One of the dangerous things in life is to mock the message of God.\r\nA lot of believers that serve God in the flesh and not in the spirit, usually mock the move of the Holy Spirit in the church today. What a sin that has no mercy!\r\n\r\nThere was also a time they gave a message to a family not to do an elaborate and well publicized wedding that would have so many people in attendance. The family of the bride mocked this message and even insulted the minister that gave it. Two weeks after the wedding, the bridegroom received a satanic arrow of mental illness. \r\n\r\nAnd there was also a time God sent me to a particular young brother that he should not attend a party. The brother looked at me and smiled and told me that nothing could stop him from going to the party.\r\nHe went to the party and on his way back home, he was involved in a fatal accident, where two people instantly died. Although the brother did not die, but he had a head injury that almost cost him his life. \r\nâ€œAnd Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.â€ I Samuel 15:22\r\nItâ€™s better for you and me to always obey the instruction of God for the good of our lives. So learn not to grieve the Holy Spirit. \r\n\r\nâ€¢	GOD IS LIMITED TO YOUR HEARTâ€™S DESIRE\r\nThis is another point we need to look at. Itâ€™s true that there could be a divine instruction from God. But this is based on the request you present to God to do for you. If you fail to let Him know what He needs to know concerning you, He will not show himself as God in your life.\r\nThank God that Jesus was told about the wine that got finished. Supposing he was not informed, nothing would have happened.\r\nâ€œAnd the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there: And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage. And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.â€ John 2:1-7.\r\n\r\nThe first thing they did was to invite Jesus to the wedding. And secondly they committed a major assignment to His hands. God will not do anything about what you donâ€™t tell Him. Some people would travel and fail to present the journey before God in prayer. And if anything happens on the way, you will hear them shouting â€˜Jesus! Jesus!!â€™ in the vehicle to be saved.\r\n\r\nThere was a time one of our members travelled somewhere after a message came out in the church that any of our members that wanted to travel at that time should come for prayer. This woman refused to come before she travelled because she reasoned within herself that I might tell her not to travel if she had come for prayer. She embarked on the journey without the leading of the Holy Spirit. Along the way, she encountered armed robbers that crossed the road and killing people. She was terrified and said to herself that she refused to tell me to pray for her over the journey; and she started praying for Godâ€™s mercy.\r\nThank God nothing happened to her. Always remember that disobedience to Godâ€™s leading leads to destruction.\r\nâ€œThere is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.â€ Proverb 16:25\r\nGod can only act on what you present before Him.\r\nâ€œAsk, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?â€ Matthew 7:7-11\r\n\r\nItâ€™s true that God knows all your heart desires, but He will not grant them if you donâ€™t present them before Him. The Scripture makes it clear that is when you ask, seek or knock that you can get your desire from God. God will not do what is humanly possible for you to do. And He cannot go beyond your heart desire also.\r\n\r\nAnother Scripture says; ask till you are full.\r\nâ€œAnd in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.â€ John 16:23-24.\r\n\r\nKeep on asking God for everything, He is merciful to do all things for as many that present their case before Him in prayer.\r\nWhatever you want to do, take it to God for Him to instruct you on how to go about it.\r\nâ€œI will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye. Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.â€ Psalm 32:8-9.\r\nThere a lot of things we miss and fail to discover without the Holy Spirit on our side to guide us.\r\n\r\nThere was a day we had an all-night prayer in the church I was attending before I started my own ministry. After the vigil, we decided to go back home that night. On getting home, I prayed to God to guide me all the night as I wanted to sleep. And to my surprise, the spirit of God told me not to sleep inside my room, but go to the balcony of the house. And I asked God why? The Spirit of God said there was an attack from the kingdom of darkness that was targeted at me that would lead to death. But to the glory of God, I obeyed the message without minding mosquitoesâ€™ bites at the balcony I was instructed to sleep. It was my prayer that made God to reveal the secret of Satan that night.\r\n\r\nPlease and please donâ€™t play with a divine instruction. And always make sure you present your cases before God for divine guidance.\r\nGod will help us in Jesusâ€™ Name. Amen', 'THE CALL OF GOD\r\nThe call of God is a very great, wonderful and powerful thing upon the life of anyone that is fortunate to receive it. It turns oneâ€™s life around for good. \r\nThe call of God has no age limit. Both the old and small can receive the call of God for a purpose. \r\nSamuel was a small boy when he received the call of God. \r\nâ€œThat the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.â€ 1 Samuel 3:4\r\nâ€œNow the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father\'s house, unto a land that I will shows thee: And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:â€ Genesis 12: 1-2 \r\nA lot of the fathers of faith, both in the Scriptures and our present age received the call of God. \r\nâ€¢	God called Noah to make an ark- Genesis 6:13-14\r\nâ€¢	Abram received the call of God to depart from his family. Genesis 12:1-3\r\nâ€¢	Moses received the call of God to lead the people of Israel from Egypt to the Promised Land. Exodus 3:1-8\r\nâ€¢	Joshua was called to complete the assignment of Moses. Joshua 1:1-2\r\nâ€¢	Gideon was also called to deliver the Israelites from the hands of their enemy. Judges 6:11-14\r\nâ€¢	Samuel received the call of God to be a prophet of Israel. 1 Samuel 3:4-6 \r\nâ€¢	God called Elijah to be a prophet. 1 Kings 19:12-13\r\nâ€¢	Prophet Elisha was also called. 1 Kings 19:19-20\r\nâ€¢	Peter received the call of God to be a fisher of men. Matthew 4:19\r\nâ€¢	Paul the Apostle also received the call of God. Galatians 1: 15-16\r\nIt was the same God that called Apostle Joseph Ayo Babalola and other great men of God.  \r\nThere are two types of calls. One is universal and the other is personal.\r\n    	 UNIVERSAL CALL \r\nA universal call is a general call that God extends to everyone unto repentance from Satan and to become His child.  \r\nâ€œCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.â€ Matthew 11:28-30\r\nA universal call is also a special assignment given to the saved to reach out to the unsaved.\r\nâ€œAnd he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.â€ Mark 16:15\r\n\r\nPERSONAL CALL\r\nA personal call is a call that is meant for certain people; which is also referred to as the five-fold ministries. \r\nâ€œAnd he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:â€ Ephesians 4: 11-13 \r\n           Let us consider the five-fold ministries one after the other:\r\nI.	Apostle: (called Apostolos in Greek). This is an ambassador of the great commission or top-ranking official who is one of the 12 members of the administrative council of the early church. Matthew 10:2, Luke 6:13\r\nII.	Prophet: A seer of God. He speaks divinely inspired messages to the people; and God speaks through him to others. Genesis 20:7, Ex. 7:1\r\nIII.	Evangelist â€“ A person who seeks to covert others to the Christian faith. 2 Timothy 4:5\r\nIV.	Pastor: This is also called shepherd. They care for the flocks. 1 Peter 5:2\r\nV.	Teacher â€“ A person who teaches and holds the second highest office in the Aaronic priesthood. John 3:2. Acts 13:1 \r\nAll these offices come through the call of God; for the perfection of the great commission that God has committed to all believers. \r\nMy questions to you as a believer in Christâ€™s vineyard is; which call are you hearing from God? Is it a universal or personal call? As a believer, you must receive one call from your Creator. And every call has a special grace of God that backs it up. \r\nThere is no one that receives the call of God and his or her life remains the same. Donâ€™t ignore the call of God upon your life for another person to take over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nâ€¢	SPIRITUAL GIFTS FOR THE ASSIGNMENT\r\nEvery call of God goes with a spiritual gift to support and confirm the call upon the minister. There is no call that is without a spiritual gift to back it up.\r\n Spiritual gifts are usually given to support the assignment of the Gospel. The Scripture makes us to understand that without signs and wonders people will not believe.\r\nâ€œThen said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.â€ John 4:48\r\nSpiritual gifts boost the Gospel and make it more effective in the heart of the people.\r\nWhen Christ sent His Disciples out to preach the Gospel to the people, He gave them power to heal and cast out evil spirits.\r\nâ€œAnd when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.â€ Mathew 10:1\r\nEvery called minister of the Gospel has one gift or the other to empower the assignment given to him or her, as well as to win more souls to the Gospel. But itâ€™s a pity today that many ministers have commercialized the gifts\r\nGod gave the gifts to profit the kingdom and not to commercialize it for selfish interest. How do you handle the gift of God that you were given for the assignment? You and I will give an account of how we used our gifts to God. \r\nProphet Elisha was a man of God that carried out his assignment according to the will of God for Israel. He did not commercialize the gifts of God upon his life. The entire Israel enjoyed the benefits of God through him.\r\nâ€œAnd Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word. And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan. And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there. So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith,that is before Jordan. And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook. And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land. And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.â€ I Kings 17:1-9\r\nProphet Elisha was a faithful servant of God that did the assignment given to him wholeheartedly and he was endowed with spiritual gifts.\r\nâ€œAnd he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.  And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.â€  2 Kings 2:14-15\r\nWhen the sons of the Prophets saw what Elisha did by using the garment of his master to divide the River Jordan, they confirmed that the Spirit of Elijah had actually rested on Elisha.\r\nSpiritual gifts confirm the call of God upon someone. It does revive the grace of God upon whoever that has the call of God upon his or her life.\r\nâ€œAnd the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is naught, and the ground barren. And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him. And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land. So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake.â€ 2 Kings 2:19-22.\r\nImmediately the grace of God was announced in the life of Prophet Elisha, his fame spread throughout the whole cities and villages.\r\nThe people of Jericho came to him and presented the challenge confronting the city before him. He made himself available freely for the assignment without demanding for money or materials things from them. Prophet Elisha healed the land and water that was bitter in the Name of God of Israel. \r\nHe also healed Naaman without collecting anything from him. He did everything to the glory of God.\r\nâ€œAnd it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel. So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.â€¦And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant. But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.â€ 2 Kings 5:8-9, 15-16\r\nNo wonder God used him greatly; as he did double the miracles that Elijah did.\r\nThe first Apostles in the New Testament also devoted themselves freely for the work of The Gospel without commercializing it.\r\n Apostle Peter and John healed many people through the spiritual gifts upon their lives, without collecting money from the people.\r\nâ€œNow Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour. And a certain man lame from his mother\'s womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple; Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms. And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us. And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them. Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength. And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God. And all the people saw him walking and praising God: And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.â€  Acts 3:1-10\r\nGod used our father in the Lord, Apostle Joseph Ayo Babalola in mighty ways. There are a lot of testimonies of what God did through him, that we are still talking about till today. Even at that, he never collected anything from anybody.\r\nThe gift of God upon your life is to promote the Gospel and not to use it for personal interest.\r\nâ€œMoreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.â€                   I Corinthians 4:2\r\nItâ€™s expected of every minister of the Gospel to be found faithful. If you are faithful with the gifts committed to your hands, you shall be rewarded greatly. God that sent you requires unwavering faithfulness from you.\r\nDonâ€™t follow what fake pastors are doing; obey God that called you for the assignment.\r\nI pray that the special grace to obey till the end will surely come upon your life in Jesusâ€™ Name.\r\nDonâ€™t ever join the chorus of the ministers that are fond of saying â€¦â€™ there is no faithful minister of God anywhere again on earth.â€™\r\nâ€œAnd he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away. â€¦Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.â€   I Kings 19:14; 18\r\nProphet Elijah thought he was the only prophet that was obeying God and felt others had bowed down to Baal. But God told him not to say that; that there were seven thousands prophets in Israel that have also refused to bow to Baal.\r\nWith the situations that do not glorify God in our country today, people do all kinds of things to survive and thereby turn against God. Some ministers of the Gospel are increasingly finding it difficult to be faithful. However, there are still few that are still faithful to God and man. Be faithful over the assignment committed into your hands. Every faithful servant shall be rewarded faithfully. Prophet Samuel was faithful to the point of death and God was with him. Be faithful!\r\nâ€¢	MINISTERS ARE GODâ€™S MOUTH-PIECE\r\nThe call of God upon every minister has nothing to do with age. He or she can be old or young.\r\nâ€œMoreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God. And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites. Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt. And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?  And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain. And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them? And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.â€ Exodus 3:6-14.\r\n\r\nThe call of God was upon Moses despite his age and being a stammerer, that was not eloquent.\r\n\r\nProphet Samuel was also small in age when God called him to be a prophet in Israel. In fact he was still under the guardianship of Priest Eli, when the call of God came upon him.\r\nâ€œAnd the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision. And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see; And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep; That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I. And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.  And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again. Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him. And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.\r\n Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place. And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth. And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.â€       I Samuel 3:1-11\r\n\r\nGod was not bothered about Samuelâ€™s age. He was still small in age, but God revealed to him a secret that was beyond his age.\r\n\r\nJeremiah tried to dialogue with God about his age and inexperience, as he thought that the assignment God wanted to commit to his hands was more than his age. But God told him that before he was born, he knew and had made him a prophet of the nation.\r\nâ€œBefore I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations. Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child. But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak. Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the LORD. Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth. See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plantâ€. Jeremiah 1:5-10.\r\n\r\nGod had already prepared Samuel and Jeremiah in the womb even before they were born. Age has nothing to do with anyone that God calls to be a minister or prophet.\r\nAll the genuine ministers of the Gospel that bear the full presence of God upon their lives could be old or young in age. It does not matter to God\r\nThey are Godâ€™s mouthpiece for the people and the nations. The whole nation hears the Word of God through them and they have special grace to do special assignments. God speaks through them and people hear divine messages through them. \r\n\r\nWhenever the people of Israel were in a situation that was not clear to them, they would contact God through His prophets or Prophetesses.\r\nâ€œAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand: That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee. And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow. And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh. And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.â€ Exodus 4:4-9\r\n\r\nBefore God will call on anyone, He would have adequately prepared such a person. God prepared Moses well before sending him to the palace of Pharaoh. The people began to receive the messages of God through him.  \r\nâ€œAnd Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.  And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel: And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.â€ Exodus 4:28-30\r\n\r\nMoses was the intermediary between God and the people. Anything that God needed to tell the children of Israel was being conveyed through him to the people. This goes to show that ministers of the Gospel are not there for the fun of it, but act as the mouth-piece of God. \r\nâ€œAnd the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.\r\nAnd it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD. And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines. Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only. And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you unto the LORD.â€ 1Samuel 7:1-5\r\n\r\nWhen the people of Israel sinned against God, they became powerless and the ark of covenant was taken from them. They went to Samuel to ask him to plead to God on their behalf. Prophet Samuel told them what to do and they obeyed. The prophet pleaded on their behalf and God forgave and set them free.\r\n\r\nDuring the time of Prophet Elijah, there wasnâ€™t rain in the land of Israel. It was the prophet that used the authority God bestowed upon him to lock up rain in heaven against the land. And he opened it again after three and half years.\r\nâ€œIn the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as the kings of Israel that were before him.â€ 2 Kings 17:1-2, \r\nâ€œAnd Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.\r\n So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees, And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times. And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man\'s hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down that the rain stop thee not. And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel. And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.â€ 1 Kings 18:41-46.\r\nMinisters of the Gospel carry great authority of God. And whatever they bind remains bound and no one can open it. And whatever they open is opened and no one can lock or close it.\r\nâ€œBut Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel\'s servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah. And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him. And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab. And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.\r\nBut now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.â€ 2 Kings 3:11-15\r\n\r\nA prophet hears from God and delivers the message to the people; and take their case to God as well. When the king of Israel wanted to fight his enemy, he sent for the prophets of Baal; but they could not give him the right answers he needed, until Prophet Elisha came and told the king the right message from God.\r\n\r\nThe ministers of God in your church are not there for fun, but representing God in the church. Maybe you attended a Bible school or even understand the Bible more than your ministers; I want to tell you that you canâ€™t obtain the special grace of God upon them in any school. Even if you know how to carry out spiritual exercises more than them, yet, they are still your spiritual fathers. He might be your child, sibling, relation, husband or wife; once he or she carries the anointing of God, please honour God in his or her life.\r\n\r\nSOME FACTS ABOUT MINISTERS OF GOD\r\ni.	They had been chosen before they were born. Jeremiah 1:5-7, Galatians 1:15.\r\nii.	They carry the fullness of God. Isaiah 61:1\r\niii.	They represent God on earth.\r\niv.	They are Godâ€™s mouth-piece as God speaks through them to the people and whatever they open or close is established in heaven.\r\nv.	They are shepherds of the sheep on earth.\r\nvi.	They are teachers of the law, which is the Word of God. Joshua 1:8\r\nvii.	They are Godâ€™s messengers on earth. They receive messages from God and deliver to the people.\r\nHonour God through them if you want to see the good side of God.\r\nSomeone once said something; that if you cannot be a friend to a man of God, donâ€™t ever be his enemy. Because God controls the affairs of the Gospel through His ministers. The more you honour God in their lives, the more God will bless you and your family.\r\n\r\n\r\nâ€¢	GOD IS NOT AN AUTHOR OF CONFUSION\r\n\r\nThe way some people see the ministers of God is as if God made a mistake in calling them. But this is very wrong. There is no mistake or confusion in whatever that God does.\r\nâ€œFor God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.â€ 1 Corinthians 14:33\r\nDonâ€™t forget that Esau did not offend God by making Jacob the head over him. The Scripture says; Jacob I love and Esau I hate. What has Esau done that would make God to hate him? It was a great mystery that no one understands.\r\nâ€œAs it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated. What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.â€ Romans 9:13-14.\r\n\r\nAlso consider the case of Moses, who killed an Egyptian and ran away. He could not speak very well; but he had a brother that was eloquent in the person of Aaron.\r\nâ€œNow therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.\r\nAnd Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?â€ \r\n\r\nâ€œAnd Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.\r\nAnd the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man\'s mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD? Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say. And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send.â€ Exodus 3:9-11, 4:10-13.\r\n\r\nMoses gave God his weaknesses, but God insisted to use him. Aaron was there that could talk very well and also has not committed any offence in Egypt.\r\n\r\nWhat happened in the family of Jesse is also worth mentioning. God sent Prophet Samuel to the family to appoint and anoint a new king for Israel. But on getting there, seven able men came out for selection and anointing. But God told Samuel not to anoint any of them. And even Samuel and Jesse got tired of the whole thing, because there wasnâ€™t any other able men like the seven presented by Jesse. But then, there still remained a small boy called David that has not been mentioned or presented in the family. Humanly speaking, David was not qualified for the position of king in Israel; but God wanted him to be there.\r\n\r\nâ€œAnd it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD\'s anointed is before him. But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart. Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this. Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this. Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither. And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he. Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.â€ I Samuel 16:6-13.\r\n\r\nDavid had no qualification that could have made him to be chosen and anointed a king in Israel; or shall we say that God made a mistake or was confused in making David a king? Of course, He did not.\r\n\r\nKing Solomon and Apostle Paul were another examples in the Bible. Solomon came through a wrong and illegitimate way. He was not as qualified as the other sons in the family of David; but God made him the next King after David in Israel.\r\nâ€œAnd he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother\'s: for it was his from the LORD.â€  I Kings 2:15.\r\n\r\nAdonijah was more qualified than Solomon in the family of David and even in the entire Israel to be made king; but God changed everything in favour of Solomon. Only God knows and understands everything.\r\nDespite killing Disciples and standing against the Gospel, Saul, who later became Apostle Paul was also chosen by God to be one of the Apostles.\r\nâ€œBut when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother\'s womb, and called me by his grace, To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:â€ Galatians 1:15-16\r\nThe Word of God makes us to understand that, God is in heaven doing what pleases Him.\r\nâ€œBut our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.â€ Psalm 115:3\r\n\r\nEven me as a person; I donâ€™t think I deserve to be a minister of the Gospel as the last child in our family. I have so many brothers and sisters that are better than me. But itâ€™s only God that understands the reason for making me one of His ministers.\r\nGod can call the educated or even the illiterates. God can call the poor or the rich. The reason for this is best known to God. Our God is the Alpha and Omega of everything. What we donâ€™t know He knows better. The requirement or qualification of God is different from that of man.\r\n\r\nA family once came to me came for prayer. But when they saw me, they were sizing me up and wondering that how could this small boy be the pastor? But to the glory of God, I attended to them and God surprised them beyond their imaginations. It was then they confessed what they had in mind when they first saw me.\r\n\r\nWhatever you see God doing in your life that is beyond your level or age, give glory to God for making you outstanding and great among the people. If God makes you what you donâ€™t deserve, donâ€™t share the glory with God and give no room for the spirit of pride to come over you.\r\nFinally, brethren donâ€™t see God as an author of confusion over anything that is not clear to you. But rather give God all the glory and donâ€™t accuse Him for anything. \r\n\r\nâ€¢	GODâ€™S BLESSING THROUGH THE PROPHET\r\nThere are a lot of blessings of God you can derive from His ministers. God had empowered them so much so that if you go to them with your challenge, God will give you a way out through them.\r\nThe five -fold ministers are full of Godâ€™s blessings.\r\nâ€œAnd he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:â€ Ephesians 4:11-12.\r\nBefore you can enjoy the blessings of God through these five-fold ministers, you need to know Christ and accept Him into your life.\r\nâ€œFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.â€ John 3:16, 1:12\r\nYou cannot stay out of Christ and be enjoying the benefits of God. God used Prophet Elijah and Elisha for their generation. The people of Israel enjoyed the blessings of God through them.\r\nâ€œAnd Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son. For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth. And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days. And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijahâ€¦ And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him. And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son? And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed. And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son? And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child\'s soul come into him again. And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.  And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth. And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth.â€   I Kings 17:13-16, 17-24.\r\n\r\nPeople of Israel enjoyed the blessings of God through Prophet Elisha as well. He did double of what Elijah did in Israel. God used him mightily, Even his dead body blessed people.\r\nâ€œAnd the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is naught, and the ground barren. And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him.  And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land.  So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake.â€ 2 Kings 2:19-22, 4:1-7, 14-17.\r\nMinisters of God are full of Godâ€™s blessings, which you can tap from and become great in life.\r\n\r\nHOW TO ENJOY THE BLESSINGS OF GOD THROUGH THE MINISTERS\r\n1.	First thing to do in order to enjoy the blessings of God in the life of a minister is to honour God that called him. By doing so, the anointing of God upon his life will rise to bless you.\r\nSome disregard God that called the minister in one way or other. You lose respect for him, because you are familiar with him or perhaps he is your relation or friend. Remember what happened between Prophet Elisha and Gehazi. Gehazi disregarded the God that called Elisha, his master. He went ahead and did what was morally and spiritually wrong.\r\n\r\nâ€œAnd he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant. But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused. And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules\' burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD. In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing. And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way. But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him. So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well? And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments. And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him. And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed.  But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither. And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants.â€      2 Kings 5:15-26\r\n\r\nGehazi allowed the Spirit of covetousness to make him dishonour the God of his master. For this reason, he received the curse that left Naaman. Same way anyone that dishonours the calling of a minister of God will receive a reward of a curse. Cultivate the habit of honouring the God that called a man of God.\r\n\r\n2.	Another thing you need to do before you can receive the blessings of God through the minister is to make sure you pray for them. Your prayer is very important to them, because most of the ministers of God you see have no time for themselves. No wonder, Apostle Paul said, they should pray for them. The more you pray for your pastor or minister, the more they will grow in anointing; and the more you shall be greatly blessed through them.\r\n\r\n An old woman that used to pray for the pastor in a church died. I was told that God revealed the case to the pastor; that the woman that normally prayed for miracles to happen through him was dead. What this implied was that there would be no more miracles again through the man of God; because the person that used to pray for him was dead. Your prayer for your pastor goes a long way in his life. Keep on praying for your pastor.\r\n\r\nIt was the prayer of the saints that delivered Apostle Peter from being killed by Herod.\r\nâ€œNow about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church. And he killed James the brother of John with the sword. And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)\r\nAnd when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people. Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.â€      Acts 12:1-5\r\n\r\nIf they had prayed for James the same way they prayed for Apostle Peter, Herod would not have been able to kill him.\r\nBut the prayer the church offered for Peter set him free from the prison of the wicked Herod. Your Pastor needs more of your prayers, if you desire Godâ€™s blessings through him.\r\n\r\n3.	The third thing you need to do in order to enjoy the blessings of God through your ministers, is to bless God through your minister with your substance. If God uses the minister to meet your needs spiritually, itâ€™s a good thing to bless him materially.\r\nSome women used their substance to support the ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ, with a pure and willing mind.\r\nâ€œAnd certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils, And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod\'s steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.â€œ  Luke 8:2-3\r\nIf you bless your pastor with your substance, it will definitely command Godâ€™s blessings into your life.\r\n\r\nA woman once told me how her father in law used to wash the clothes of Apostle Joseph Ayodele Babalola when he was alive. She said that even when the man of God died, there were some clothes of the man of God in the custody of the father in law, which he had to return. And God used the ministry of Apostle Joseph Ayodele Babalola to bless the man and all his children and even grandchildren.\r\n\r\nSaul and the servant of his father went to see Prophet Samuel. And they went with a little substance for the man of God. For this goodwill of Saul, he left there with a unique blessing of kingship. What a great blessing!\r\nâ€œAnd he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honorable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can show us our way that we should go. Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we? And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.â€        â€œNow the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying, To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me. And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people. Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer\'s house is.â€ I Samuel 9:6-8, 15-18.\r\n\r\nIf you bless the man of God with what you have, you are commanding an automatic blessing of God upon your life.\r\n\r\n4.	Another point is that make your minister your close friend in the Lord; not for any ungodly or immoral motive, so that he can lead you in the way of the Lord. You can only tell your close friend your problem; but making the minister of God your close friend will help you to enjoy the blessings of God through him.\r\n5.	Be faithful to your pastor in all things. Donâ€™t be like Gehazi and Judas Iscariot that disappointed their masters. It requires genuine faithfulness before you can enjoy the blessing of God through your minister.\r\nA member of the church playing a double game with his pastor is definitely playing with his or her destiny. Be hundred percent faithful to your pastor.\r\nâ€œMoreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.â€            I Corinthians 4:2\r\nAn unfaithful person cannot receive anything good from God through the man of God, but a curse.\r\n6.	Lastly, donâ€™t hide anything for your minister. One thing that is very certain is that; you donâ€™t hide things for a medical doctor that will treat you. You donâ€™t hide anything from a lawyer that will handle your case. I advise that you donâ€™t hide anything from your pastor that will take your case to God.\r\n\r\nTaking all these steps into consideration will help you to enjoy the blessings of God through the minister of God you are under his ministry.\r\nMinisters of God are the product of wonders in the hands of God. Learn to honour them. Your blessings from God shall be delivered to you through them in Jesusâ€™ Mighty Name. Amen.', 'THE MYSTERY OF KINGDOM EXPANSION\r\nGod is the Creator of everything; both in heaven and on earth. He owns all things. \r\nâ€œAll things were made by him; and without him was not anything made that was made.â€ John 1:3\r\nHowever, God uses the expansion of His kingdom on earth as an avenue of blessings to every believer that understands the mystery and key into it. \r\nKing David had the full understanding of the kingdom of God on earth and he decided to build a house for God in his heart. But God sent Prophet Nathan to him not to build a house for Him, because his hands were full of blood. \r\nâ€œThat the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains. And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart; for the LORD is with thee. And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying,Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?â€ II Samuel 7:2-5 \r\nâ€œAnd David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God: But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.â€1 Chronicle 22:7-8.\r\nDespite being denied the privilege of building a house for God, David went ahead and bought all the materials for the intended house, because he understood the mystery of working for God.\r\nâ€œNow, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto. Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work. Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the LORD be with thee. David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying.â€  1 Chronicles 22:14-17.\r\nHowever, God told David that, his son (Solomon) shall build the house for Him. And David bought all the materials needed for the house which is as good as being the person that actually built it.\r\nThe blessings that came to the family of David in working for God was beyond human understanding. The God of Israel used everything in Israel to bless King David and his descendants. \r\nâ€œAnd Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places. And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar. In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee. And Solomon said, Thou hast showed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in. And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?And the speech pleased the LORD, that Solomon had asked this thing.â€ I kings 3:3-10.\r\nThe spirit of working for God also came upon Solomon, the son of David. King Solomon promoted the Kingdom of God by building a house for God and also made a great sacrifice unto Him, even more than David, his father.\r\nImagine someone blessing God with an outstanding and great sacrifice and God was well pleased. With what Solomon did for God, God visited him in the dream and asked him to request for whatever he needed. \r\nIâ€™ve never seen anyone that works for God with genuine mind without being blessed. Everyone that I know that worked for God reaped abundant blessings in return.\r\nI was told about a man in this country that used his son as a collateral where he was lent some money to buy a keyboard for the church he was attending. God rewarded this man beyond the level of his faith. The son the man used as a collateral at that time later became a president of this nation. \r\nEven my dear father of blessed memory, used what he had to promote the work of God when he was alive. And we the children are still reaping the dividends of that till today.\r\nOne thing I want you to understand today is that, nothing is too big or small to give to God. Every giver to the work of God becomes a great receiver of His bountiful blessings in return. \r\nâ€œGive, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.â€ Luke 6:38. \r\nLet your giving comes from a good source and genuine mind of love, because God loves a cheerful giver and not otherwise. \r\nâ€œHappy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.â€  2 Corinthians 9:7 \r\nGiving to Godâ€™s kingdom commands great blessings to the life of the giver. Check the Scriptures and you will discover that no one gave to promote the kingdom assignment that did not receive blessings in multiple folds. It takes great and genuine love to give what you have to God.\r\nThere is no one that God does not expect to give to the kingdom. God expects both the rich and the poor. Also there is no one that doesnâ€™t have something to give. If you donâ€™t have money, you will have strength to work for God or if you donâ€™t have money or strength, you will have ideas or suggestions you can contribute. In other words, use what you have to promote the kingdom of God. To work for God is by grace and not by any special qualification. Donâ€™t misuse the grace.\r\nI pray that nobody will replace you in the presence of God in Jesusâ€™ Name. \r\n\r\nâ€¢	STRENGTH OF OFFERINGS \r\nOfferings in the house of God carry great strength in promoting the kingdom of God on earth.\r\nThe church of God cannot stand properly without offerings, because there are many financial demands to meet.\r\nThe offerings the church collects from individuals are not equal. I mean people give offerings according to their pockets or levels. Some give huge offerings, while some give small. So when these are combined, it becomes a reasonable amount of money that can be used to promote the kingdom of God.\r\nYou may be surprised to note that not every minister of the Gospel understands the mystery behind the offerings collected in the church.\r\nSome are so greedy to the extent that they manipulate the offerings that come to the ministry. Such a ministry or church cannot grow, but automatically remains stagnant. \r\nIf members of a church are very faithful in paying their offerings, it will change many things in that ministry and many problems or challenges will be settled. \r\nThe following are the common offerings in the church of God:\r\nI.	Thanksgiving Offering: This offerings helps to take good care of ministers that work in the ministry. And it is also used to sort out some other things in the church.\r\nII.	Project offering: This is used to handle the aspect of church building â€“ the worship center or auditorium, as well as its maintenance.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s a pity that some ministers or leaders of the Gospel are fond of diverting such offerings to personal use. Such a ministry cannot experience any positive or remarkable growth.\r\nAnother thing the so-called ministers normally do is that, after using the church project offering for personal or wrong motive, they will begin to pray to God to send someone that can give huge money for the church building project to them. What a wrong prayer!\r\nDonâ€™t forget that God is not interested in someone that wastes the kingdom resources. Check your ways, how are you investing or wasting Godâ€™s money?\r\nIII.	Needy offering: This is another powerful offering that helps the kingdom of God to move forward.\r\nDonâ€™t forget that we are not equal in the house of God, we have both the rich and the poor and we must pay full attention to the needy; I mean the less-privileged. Some churches would say they donâ€™t have time for the needy. If you donâ€™t have time for them, what is the meaning or relevance of your Gospel on earth?\r\nOur Lord Jesus took care of the needy during His earthly mission. What some ministers or churches could have used to meet some needs of the less-privileged in their midst, have been diverted to something else that canâ€™t benefit the needy in any way.\r\nIf the needy of your church or ministry should cry to God for being neglected and God answers their prayer, such a ministry will have a very serious problem. Please and please, pay attention to the needy in your church; let there be a needy offering and use it for them and not for something else.\r\nEvery church or ministry that cares for the needy, will enjoy the great mercy of God. In other words, if you need mercy; try to show mercy to others.\r\nâ€œBlessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble. The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies. The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.â€ Psalm 41: 1-3.\r\nAs you need help from God, so also do the needy in your church need your help. Donâ€™t neglect them.\r\nIV.	Special offering: This offering is necessary once in a while and not every time. It also helps in promoting the work of God in the church. \r\nThere was a time a church wanted to buy a keyboard; and special offerings were collected four times and the money was realized. But the presiding pastor of the church used the money for his own personal issue. The church was now wondering why the keyboard had still not been bought and the presiding pastor started telling funny lies about what happened to the money.\r\nMinisters of the Gospel, stop diverting the special offerings taken in the church for something contrary. This offering is meant for the work of God and nothing else. Indulging in such an act will destroy your integrity. If you are doing this, amend your ways before it is too late.\r\nProphet Offering: The church executives need to understand that the prophet offering is for the man of God that Heâ€™s using for the Gospel assignment. \r\nâ€œAnd he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honorable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can show us our way that we should go. Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we? And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way. (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer. Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was.â€ 1 Samuel 9:6-10\r\n If God uses a minister for you; it is your responsibility to bless him with your substance. Whatever you are giving to the minister you are under his ministration is called a prophet offering. \r\nâ€œIt hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.â€ Romans 15:27\r\nItâ€™s your responsibility to bless your minister with what you have weekly, monthly or quarterly, depending on your ability. And as you do this, God has a way of blessing you in return. You are not doing this to help the minister, but it is a sure way to attract the blessings and favour of God upon your life.\r\n If you stop giving to the minister because he fails to praise you, God will raise other people that are godlier than you to bless him.\r\nWhatever God lays in your heart to give to your pastor or minister should not be viewed from a negative angle. Just give and leave the rest to God. Obedience to this attracts mercy, favour and blessings of God.\r\nEvery good and godly intentions that generate offerings to the kingdom of God, bring progress to the church. Itâ€™s a great mystery which many do not understand.\r\n\r\nâ€¢	USE WHAT YOU HAVE\r\nNothing is too small or big to give to God. In the first instance, God is the giver of every good thing and itâ€™s expected of you to return it back to God.\r\nAnother thing you need to understand is that, everyone is expected to give in the house of God. Donâ€™t ever say you donâ€™t have anything; but I want to tell you today that you have something you can give to promote the kingdom of God.\r\nâ€œAnd Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying, Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD; gold, and silver, and brass, And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats\' hair, And rams\' skins dyed red, and badgers\' skins, and shittim wood, And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for the sweet incense, And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the breastplate.â€  Exodus 35:4-9\r\nItâ€™s not necessary that you should bring money. You can give God your time. Imagine what God commanded the people of Israel to do for Him in the wilderness. Israelites were not in their house or country, but in the wilderness; and yet God demanded an offering from them. \r\nThere was a time we needed money to carry out a particular project in the church. Someone brought certain amount of money for the project, but others that didnâ€™t have money to give devoted their time and energy for the work. While another person collected the money and bought all the materials for the project; and also crafted certain designs needed for the job free of charge. \r\nThere was also an old woman who had no money to give for the project as well, but she brought some garri and groundnut for the workers doing the construction.\r\nEveryone that gives to the work of God shall receive blessings. Make sure that whatever you are giving to God comes from a willing mind. Even God told Moses to tell the people of Israel to bring things for Him from their willing mind; and not as if they were being forced.\r\nSome ministers of the Gospel are fond of collecting offerings from members of the church with powerful curses. Such is not biblical, but intimidation.\r\nThe Bible stipulates that giving must come from a willing mind and not by curses from any minister to force or create fear in the mind of anyone to pay. Ministers of the Gospel should stop operating outside the Bible. All our teachings and doctrines must be guided by the biblical injunctions. Ministers should also stop praising anyone that contributes an offering and neglecting people that do not. If it is time or material that anyone gives, provided itâ€™s from a willing mind, it will surely attract the blessing of God. But please, donâ€™t give God a bad offering. I mean whatever you are giving God, let it be a good seed and not poor or wretched one.\r\nCan you imagine some people bringing ill-gotten money from fraud or dubious means to the house of God? Well, for your information, itâ€™s pastor that receives such money from you and not God. But any pastor that is spiritual will definitely know and reject such money or offering that is not clean. So always give your God a good and acceptable offering, so as to attract His blessing. The offering of Abel was acceptable unto God, while the offering of Cain was rejected. Why? Simply because Abelâ€™s offering was good while Cainâ€™s offering was bad. \r\nâ€œAnd in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering: But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.â€ Genesis 4:3-7\r\nYour offering to God will determine your worth before Him. Whatever a man sows, same shall he reaps. One thing many fail to understand is that, God respects someone that gives Him a good offering and disregards anyone that gives Him a bad offering.\r\nAlways check your offering and ask yourself; is this acceptable to God or not? A good heart will bring forth a good offering to God. This implies that, a bad or unwilling heart cannot bring a good offering to God. The condition of your heart will determine your offering to God. Remember, God says a willing mind and not a mind that is forced or compelled.\r\nGod will grant you grace to have the understanding of the state of the mind in Jesusâ€™ Mighty Name.\r\nEveryone has one thing or other to give to the kingdom of God. Give what you have. If you are not faithful to God now that you are not rich, you cannot be faithful when you eventually become rich. God expects from everyone in the church to give in order to promote the work of God.  \r\n\r\nâ€¢	REWARDS OF WORKING FOR GOD\r\nEvery work in the house of God will surely be rewarded either good or bad.\r\nâ€œFor the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.â€ Mathew 16:27\r\nâ€œAnd, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.â€ Revelations 22:12\r\nThe rewards of God to everyone working in His vineyard are two. Your reward on earth and another reward waiting for you in heaven.\r\nIf you do well while serving in the house of God, you shall be rewarded; and if doing the work of God as you like is your own habit, you shall be rewarded accordingly. Whatever you are doing in the house of God either good or bad, there is a record for everything in heaven. Please amend your ways today before it is too late.\r\nGehazi thought he could commit that evil without been rewarded. The reward came upon him immediately.\r\nâ€œBut Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him. So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well? And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.\r\nAnd Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him. And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed. But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither. And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants? The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.â€ 2 Kings 5:20-27\r\nYou can hide your evil plan from man, but not from God that knows and sees everything. The eyes of God behold everything both in heaven and on earth.\r\nâ€œThe eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.â€ Proverbs 15:3\r\nWhatever you are doing in the house of God, the owner of the church is seeing you; itâ€™s better to change and repent from your evil ways today.\r\nâ€œIf my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.â€ 2 Chronicles 7:14\r\nWhen my father was alive, he made himself available for God to be used. And he used all that he had to promote the work of God in every area of the ministry. No wonder we, his children, are enjoying the dividends of that today.\r\n I donâ€™t deserve the level that I am in the ministry today. Itâ€™s by the special grace of God that has made this possible, due to the good works my father did in the vineyard of God. Therefore, you will reap whatever you are doing right now in the house of God, either good or bad. But it is better you engage in good works in the house of God so that you can reap a good reward.\r\nâ€œAlexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:â€ 2 Timothy 4:14\r\nA man called Alexander did evil in the ministry of Paul and he was cursed greatly. As I stated earlier, whatever a man sows, so shall he reaps. Donâ€™t also forget Ananias and Sapphira in the Bible; a couple that worked against the progress of the Gospel in the book of Acts.\r\nâ€œBut a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession, And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles\' feet. But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land? Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God. And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things. And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him. And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in. And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much. Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out.â€ Acts 5:1-9\r\nAnanias and his wife thought they could deceive the Holy Spirit and go scot free without receiving the reward. But their reward came at once and the two of them died without mercy. Many have lost the fear of God and take delight in engaging in evil things in the vineyard of God. Donâ€™t forget that everyone shall give account of his or her stewardship unto God.\r\nâ€œSo then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.â€ Romans 14:12\r\nMinisters of the Gospel shall give their account; so also shall members of the church give account unto God.\r\nHow are you handling the offering that is meant for Godâ€™s work in your possession? Are you faithful to it or not? Remember, the heavenly record is recording everything till that day of judgment.\r\nCheck and amend your ways today with genuine repentance. God loves a sinner but hates the sin he or she is committing. If you handle the things of God that called you to the ministry wholeheartedly, He will reward you greatly both on earth and in heaven.\r\nLearn from others that have gone ahead of us. Our father in the Lord, Apostle Ayodele Babalola carried out his own assignment diligently and faithfully when he was alive. He is dead, but we still talk of his good works today and till Christ comes back.\r\nLet God records good things about you. The church belongs to God; itâ€™s neither any man nor pastorâ€™s property. Beware of whatever that belongs to God. You know that project offering is not yours and it belongs to God; then use it for that purpose and nothing else. God that rewards faithfulness will surely reward you.\r\nâ€œFaithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.â€ I Thessalonians 5:24\r\nGod that sent you requires strict faithfulness from you. Please donâ€™t disappoint Him.\r\nâ€œMoreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.â€ I Corinthians 4:2\r\nMaybe you have not been handling the things of God faithfully well during the time of ignorance. You can repent today and be forgiven by God.\r\nGod loves you; be a faithful servant to Godâ€™s assignment inside and outside. I pray that God will help you to be faithful in Jesusâ€™ Name. \r\nA bad servant can repent and become a good one by accepting Jesus into his or her life. And by so doing, you shall be given a regenerated mind of God. Some servants were good before, but the wrong company they associated with, led them to wrong doings in the Godâ€™s vineyard.\r\nâ€œBe not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.â€ 1 Corinthians 15:33\r\nThe company you keep matters a lot to your life. If you are associating with an upright person, your life will be upright; but if you are moving with a wayward person, you will definitely be wayward. Examine your life and adjust your ways.\r\nâ€œSo then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.â€ Romans 14:12\r\nBoth the small and old servants shall give account of him or herself unto God. The day of reckoning is at hand. If you are a good servant, for example, you donâ€™t need to bribe your way to be taken to a higher level; but rather your diligence, good conduct and character will take you to the top. Be good to your master and every assignment committed to your hands. God will grant you the grace to be good in Jesusâ€™ Name.\r\nNo matter how bad or strict your master may be, provided you are good, he will be willing to give you a good appraisal.', 'THE SECRET OF A SERVANT\r\nThe perception of many people about a servant is quite different from the Biblical interpretation.\r\nSome people see a servant as a cursed person under a heavy yoke of servitude. But the Bible makes us to understand that being a servant is the beginning of aiming for a greater height of glory in life.\r\nSo then; who is a servant? A servant is someone who serves others or provides help in certain ways.\r\nâ€œWho, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:â€ Philippians 2:6-7\r\nJust imagine how Jesus Christ came to this world and left all His glory in heaven. He was born in the likeness of man and put on the garment of a servant.\r\nIt took me time to imagine how our Lord Jesus made Himself a servant in order to redeem mankind back to God. What a great assignment!\r\n Let us consider the attributes of a servant:\r\nI.	Humility: Everyone that cultivates the spirit of humility will surely excel in glory. Iâ€™ve never seen a true servant putting on the garment of pride but humility. \r\nâ€œAnd being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the crossâ€. Philippians 2:8\r\nII.	Faithfulness: Every good servant possesses the spirit of faithfulness in everything he or she does. \r\nâ€œMoreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.â€             I Corinthians 4:2\r\nIII.	Diligence: This is another attribute of a servant. He or she works conscientiously and never gets tired. \r\nâ€œBut Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I workâ€. John 5:17\r\nIV.	Genuine love to assignment: A good servant will show genuine love towards the assignment committed to his or her hands.\r\nV.	Time conscious: Every good servant keeps to time. They donâ€™t have time to waste when it comes to fulfilling Godâ€™s assignment. \r\nâ€œTo every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;â€ Ecclesiastes 3:1-2\r\nVI.	Not selfish or self-centered: Servant satisfies his or her master before him or herself. Christ became poor for us to become rich. \r\nâ€œFor ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.â€ 2 Corinthians 8:9\r\nVII.	Ready to take any risk for the assignment: Servant takes a risk in order to meet the need of his or her mandate. Our Lord Jesus Christ took a lot of risks in order to save mankind. \r\nâ€œHe is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healedâ€. Isaiah 53:3-5.\r\nVIII.	Possess the spirit of honour: A good servant has an attribute of honour; and so he or she honours his or her master and others.\r\nâ€œServants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;â€ Ephesians 6:5\r\nIX.	Always joyful: A good servant under a good leader cultivates the heart of joy towards the master and the assignment. Joseph was full of joy in the house of Potiphar. \r\nâ€œRejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoiceâ€. Philippians 4:4\r\nX.	Hopeful: Another attribute of a good servant is that, he or she is hopeful of a better future and knows that a day is coming he or she will become a master also. \r\nâ€œBut he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.â€ Job 23:10.\r\nWe that are ministers of the Gospel are servants to the Almighty God; and it is expected of us to possess all these attributes.\r\nBut if there is any minister of the Gospel that lacks these attributes, he or she is not a good servant of God, but an agent of the devil. \r\nâ€œAnd the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.â€ Exodus 33:11\r\nâ€œAnd Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid themâ€. Numbers 11:28\r\nJoshua was a good servant to Moses, his master and he had all the good attributes of a servant. No wonder, he became a great person during his time.\r\nWhen Jesus Christ finished His assignment here on earth as a servant, He was highly exalted above all things both in heaven and on earth; because He carried out the assignment faithfully.\r\nâ€œWherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.\r\n Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.â€  Philippians 2:9-12   \r\nFriend, are you a good servant in that office or assignment committed into your hands? People might not be seeing how you handle the assignment, but donâ€™t forget that what goes around comes around. Also, God the rewarder, will reward every work accordingly.\r\nI want you to learn from this story: There were two brothers that were given a certain amount of money for a contract to build a mansion each. The first brother collected the money for the project and bought fake materials and built the house anyhow; while the second brother bought good materials and built the house very well.\r\nWhen they finished building, their master came back to assess how they both performed. And to their surprise he told them that each of them owned the mansion he built. Have we learnt any lesson from this? You shall reap whatever that you sow.\r\nGod loves you. Consider your ways and start being a good servant that God can be proud of at any time.\r\n\r\nâ€¢	THE TEST OF GOD\r\nBefore one can be promoted to the next level of glory in life, one must pass through one test or the other. A test can come from God or from man to man. Abraham went through the test of God. God told him to sacrifice Isaac, his one and only child unto Him. A child he and Sarah his wife had in their old age for that matter.\r\nâ€œAnd it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am. And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you. And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together. And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering? And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together. And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.\r\n And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I. And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me. And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son. And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.â€ Genesis 22:1-14\r\n\r\nAnd to the glory of God, Abraham did not fail the test of God. He took with him Isaac and was willing to sacrifice him unto God. This case of Abrahamâ€™s test looks so surprising to so many people. How could someone sacrifice a child he has been praying to God to have? And after his prayer for a child was answered, God wanted the same child to be sacrificed unto Him. Why did God not demand for sheep, goat or any other animal for the sacrifice as was the practice, but Isaac? Of course, it was a great test.\r\nThe children of Israel also passed through many tests of God in the wilderness.\r\nâ€œAll the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers. And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no. And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live. Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years. Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee. Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.â€ Deuteronomy 8:1-6\r\nIt has been often said that, before you can be promoted to a higher level of glory, you must go through the test of God. What God did to the children of Israel in the wilderness was a great test to humble them and instill in their hearts not to forget Him, by the time they possessed the Promised land, where there was a  flow of milk and honey and all other good things. \r\nAnd any servant that desires promotion from his or her master must also be tested. Joseph passed through a very difficult test in the house of Potiphar his master in Egypt.\r\nâ€œAnd it came to pass after these things, that his master\'s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me. But he refused, and said unto his master\'s wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand; There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God? And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her. And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within. And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.  And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth, That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice: And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out. And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home. And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me: And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out. And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled. And Joseph\'s master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king\'s prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.â€ Genesis 39:7-20\r\nConsider a situation where everything was committed to the hands of a servant so much that he was delegated the power to do whatever he liked. But even at that, Joseph did not allow that to get into his head. In that passage, his masterâ€™s wife told him to sleep with her, but he refused mindless of what could be the consequence of his action.\r\nMany servants today cannot do what Joseph did. As a matter of fact, some will be planning to kill their master and claim all that belongs to him including the wife. But Joseph preferred to go to prison to committing sin against his master and God. No wonder, his promotion was great and unique. He became what no one had ever become in his time. \r\n\r\nHow have you fared in your own test as a servant? Either your master is there or not, how trustworthy are you? Donâ€™t forget that the master of Joseph was not around when his wife attempted to lure him to sleep with her; but yet, he did not fail his master or disappoint his God.\r\nMany servants would have become a master but their bad or questionable character towards their master has relegated them.\r\nWhen you talk of servants who failed their masters in the Bible, Gehazi was a good example.\r\nâ€œBut Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him. So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well? And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments. And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him. And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed. But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither. And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants? The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.â€ 2 Kings 5:20-27\r\n\r\nGehazi thought he could do anything without his master knowing. But it was quite unfortunate for him, that the spirit of his master followed him. He was an unfaithful servant, who was the architect of the problem that befell him and his generation. \r\n\r\nJust because of worldly things, many have lost their glory. After Prophet Elisha, Gehazi would have become the next prophet of his time. But look at the unprofitable benefit that made him destroy his future glory.\r\nCheck your life in that office; are you faithful to your boss or superior? \r\nCan your faithfulness be put to test? If yes, will you pass or fail?\r\n\r\nThere was a cleaner that was tested in the office that he was working. He was a graduate but he took up the job because after graduating from the university, he was jobless for some time. So he decided to take any available job to keep body and soul together. \r\n\r\nSo in the office, this cleaner was tempted to engage in a deal that would obviously compromise the progress of the company. They promised to give him a huge amount of money if he complied. However, this man refused and told them he preferred to die a wretched man to getting rich and go to hell fire. He didnâ€™t know he was only being tested by the management. And so as he did not fail the test, he was immediately rewarded and promoted from his post as a cleaner to general manager! \r\nI pray for you, you will not fail the test that will take you to attain higher glory in the Mighty Name of Jesus.\r\n\r\n Expect the test of your stewardship. Even though you must have been praying to God to promote you; but donâ€™t forget that before your promotion, a test will surely come. Every good servant always passes the test of their master. You will not fail in Jesusâ€™ Name.\r\n\r\nDavid had every opportunity to become everything in the palace of King Saul. The king tested him in many ways and he never failed any of the tests.\r\n\r\nâ€And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul\'s servants.â€ I Samuel 18:5, 14-18.\r\n\r\nDavid was a servant under the leadership of King Saul in Israel. But he behaved wisely in the palace and God was with him.\r\n\r\nOur Lord Jesus Christ, the Saviour of the world also came as a servant and never failed or disappointed God while on earth. Satan tested Him in many ways but He overcame all the tests.\r\nâ€œBeing forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered. And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread. And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God. And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it. If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence: For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee:  And in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season.â€ Luke 4:2-13.\r\n\r\nIf our Lord Jesus could overcome all the tests or temptations of the devil, you will surely overcome yours in Jesusâ€™ Mighty Name.\r\nSomeone once said, â€˜no cross, no crown.â€™ What this means is that, without a test, there will be no promotion, either from man or God. You will not fail the exam of life in Jesusâ€™ Name. Every man has one question or the other to answer before achieving any goal in life. You will not miss yours in life in Jesusâ€™ Name.\r\n\r\nâ€¢	THE HEART OF A SERVANT\r\nThe heart of a servant is very vital towards the assignment committed to his or her hands. A servant will either possess a good or bad heart or mind for his or her assignment. \r\nâ€œLet this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:â€ Philippians 2:5\r\nEvery good heart comes from God. The heart of man is prone to do good or evil. But whoever that surrenders his or her heart unto God will receive His support. Anyone that wants to be good in life must have a contact with God through Christ. Accepting Jesus into your life will give you a regenerated heart or mind. It will make you a true child of God that can also reason like Him; and it will be very easy for you to do good.\r\n\r\nJoseph believed God of his father and possessed a good mind towards his master and the assignment committed to his hands. Itâ€™s not every servant that possesses a good heart towards their master and the assignment. \r\nSupposing Joseph lacked a good heart, he wouldnâ€™t have been able to do all that he did in the house of Potiphar.\r\n\r\nEverything you are doing in the physical comes from your heart, because the heart of man is the center of wisdom or the workshop of reasoning. The thought in the heart motivates the physical action. You cannot compare the heart of Joseph to the heart of Gehazi, for instance, despite the fact that Gehazi was with a great prophet that was operating with the Word of God.\r\n\r\nBut the Word of God had no place in the heart of Gehazi. He was after the worldly things due to the bad mind he possessed. Donâ€™t be surprised seeing someone that has been with a great man of God and you cannot see the signs of God in his or her life. Because of his wrong mind, Gehazi failed himself and disappointed his master. \r\n\r\nJoseph wasnâ€™t only a servant in the house of Potiphar, but he was outstanding and well behaved because of the good mind he had towards the assignment and his master. Imagine someone working under somebody and all he or she thinks in his or her mind is how to defraud the person and turn him or her to nothing. Such a servant is heartless and an agent of Satan. You will find a servant like this in almost every nook and cranny of the world. In government or even in the vineyard of God, you will see them there.\r\n\r\nBefore you can become a good servant, you must possess the heart of a good servant. A good servant is not written on the forehead, but on the heart of the servant. Before you can become a master, you have to start from the level of a servant and your conduct while a servant will determine how great you will become in life when you eventually become a master. Donâ€™t forget that what goes around comes around.\r\n However, a bad servant can become a good servant by accepting Jesus into his or her life and be given a regenerated mind of God. Some servants were good before, but due to wrong company they kept, they were being influenced into wrong doings.\r\nâ€œBe not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.â€                   1 Corinthians 15:33\r\nAlso remember that your heart will determine your success in the assignment you are doing. The Scripture says; if the tree is good, the fruits will equally be good; but if the tree is bad, definitely the fruits will be bad. A good heart attracts blessing and breakthrough. Be good from the depth of your heart.\r\nâ€¢	A TYRANT OR LEADER?\r\nThere is no how we would talk about a servant that we would not mention the master to the servant. All masters are not equal. A master is either a tyrant or leader. A master that is a tyrant is a task master like King Pharaoh that knew not Joseph. He dealt with the children of Israel beyond control that God had to intervene.\r\n\r\nSome servants become bad because of the way their master that is a tyrant maltreats them. Some masters, for instance, fail to give food to their servants on time. Some servants may eat breakfast, say by 4pm; when are such servants going to take lunch? That is if that will even be provided.\r\nâ€œNow there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph. And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we: Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land. Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses. But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel. And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor: And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigor.â€ Exodus 1:8-14\r\n\r\nThe people of Egypt made life difficult for the children of Israel. They were cruel or tyrannical masters over them. Some masters are not friendly to their servants and because the servants do not have Christ in their lives, they pay the masters back with wickedness. But a master that possesses the heart of God and good leadership, handles his servant as part of his family and therefore enjoys the service of the servant, who will want to be good and loyal in return. \r\n\r\nPotiphar was a good master to Joseph. He handled Joseph with good hands and committed everything in his household to him and made him to be next to him in the house. It was the wife that influenced him and changed his mind against Joseph.  \r\nâ€œAnd the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian. And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand. And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand. And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian\'s house for Joseph\'s sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.  And he left all that he had in Joseph\'s hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favored.â€ Genesis 39:2-6\r\n\r\nJoseph was good and also met a good leader that favoured him in all things.\r\nAs a master, be a good leader not and not a tyrant.\r\n\r\nOur Lord Jesus was good to His Disciples in all aspects. He taught them, prayed for them and cared for them in all ways.\r\nâ€œFor I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me. I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine. And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them. And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are. While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled. And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves. I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.â€ John 17:8-17\r\n\r\nAll the thoughts of Jesus towards His Disciples were good.\r\nâ€œFor I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.â€ Jeremiah 29:1\r\nAny good leader that prays for his servant will surely enjoy the good side of the servant.\r\n\r\nMasters or leaders at home or that office, are you a leader or a tyrant to your subordinates? Mind you, you will reap whatever you sow. Some servants could sacrifice their time or even life for the sake of a good leader. \r\n\r\nYou the general overseer in that ministry, who are you to the servants under you? Can they give a good report about you? Check your ways and make every necessary amendment.\r\nSome good masters can help their servants achieve their dreams in life.\r\nDonâ€™t forget that a servant will become a master one day. \r\nOur current Vice President, Prof. Osinbajo was once a commissioner under the former governor of Lagos state, Governor Babatunde Fashola. But today, Babatunde Fashola is a minister under Prof. Osinbajo. What a great God!  \r\nYour servant of today, might be your future saviour; so be good to him or her.\r\n\r\nâ€¢	REWARDS OF FAITHFULNESS\r\nMany people see faithfulness as foolishness. But then God demands faithfulness from every believer.\r\nSome people think being unfaithful is a way of being clever or smart to enrich their pockets. They have forgotten that every unfaithfulness shall not go unpunished by God. With all the rights that Joseph had in the house of Potiphar, his master, he played his roles faithfully. \r\nâ€œAnd Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand. And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian\'s house for Joseph\'s sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field. And he left all that he had in Joseph\'s hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favored. And it came to pass after these things, that his master\'s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me. But he refused, and said unto his master\'s wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;\r\nThere is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God? And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.\r\n And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within. And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.â€ Genesis 39:4-12\r\nMany today cannot do what Joseph did in the house of Potiphar. He was faithful in the presence of his master and even in his absence.  Even when his faithfulness landed him in prison, he was still faithful to everyone to the extent that they made him a leader in the prison.\r\nâ€œAnd Joseph\'s master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king\'s prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison. But the LORD was with Joseph, and showed him mercy, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison. And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph\'s hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it. The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper.â€ Genesis 39:20-23.\r\nIn spite of what he passed through, he never compromised his faithfulness. It was his faithfulness in the house of Potiphar that led him to prison; and that did not affect his conduct or character in any way.\r\nWhat some people are getting in the office or their masterâ€™s house has polluted their faithfulness. Joseph did not allow what he went through to move him. He maintained his faithfulness to the last. If you endure to the last, against all odds, you shall eat the fruits of your faithfulness.\r\nâ€œMoreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.â€ 	           I Corinthians 4:2.\r\nJoseph was a servant in the house of Potiphar. From there, he became a prisoner over an offence he did not commit. But in the end, God rewarded his faithfulness and established him in the palace of Pharaoh as the second in command.\r\nâ€œAnd Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath showed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art: Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph\'s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck; And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh called Joseph\'s name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.â€ Genesis 41:39-45.\r\nAnyone that plays his or her lawful role faithfully before God and man, will always receive the best reward from God. Joseph was faithful in all things. Some are only faithful in the church but not in the office. While some are only faithful to someone they expect to do them a favour. Faithfulness is expected in all our ways.\r\nGehazi was not faithful to his master because of his desire for worldly things. And he got a reward of leprosy because of his unfaithfulness.\r\nâ€œBut Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him. So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well? And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.\r\nAnd Naaman said, Be content, take two talents . And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him. And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed. But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither. And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants? The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.â€ 2 Kings 5:20-27\r\nMany have destroyed their faithfulness to their master because of covetousness.\r\nRemember Joseph was a servant under Potiphar as Gehazi was also a servant under the leadership of Prophet Elisha. Joseph was faithful to his master, while Gehazi was unfaithful to his own master. Joseph received a great reward of faithfulness and became a great leader, while the unfaithfulness of Gehazi brought leprosy upon him and his generation.\r\nThe end result of faithfulness is greatness, while unfaithfulness leads to destruction. Faithfulness is required of every good servant.\r\nI pray that the special grace to be ever faithful to God and our leaders shall come upon us in Jesusâ€™ Mighty Name.

Of course, anyone who does that will be called a thief. Similarly, there is no Christian that will receive anything from God without faith.\r\n\r\n\"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. \"Hebrews 11:1\r\n\r\nMy own conclusion regarding faith is that, it is the money spent in heaven. And so it\'s the heavenly currency. If you lack it, you cannot get anything from God.\r\n\r\nHeavenly Currency God will not consider the years you have spent in the church before answering your prayer, but rather the level of your faith. \"But without faith it is impossible to please him; for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.\" Hebrews 11:6\r\n\r\nYou might be handsome, pretty or ugly; but that has nothing to do with God in answering your prayer. It is your faith that attracts the attention of God to your prayer more than anything else.\r\n\r\nFaith is the money that believers spend in heaven and which guarantees an answer to their prayers. Don\'t forget that it was faith that set the woman with the issue of blood free from her sickness of twelve years.\r\n\r\n\"And behold, a woman which was disease with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, a touched the hem of his garment.\" Mathew 9:20-22 and Just imagine the miracle that happened in the life of that woman. She touched the garment of Jesus and her faith touched the heart of Jesus and she received her miracle.\r\n\r\nThe blind man that heard that Jesus was passing where he was sitting begging for alms is another good example to consider. A blind man that couldn\'t. identify anybody; but he heard that Jesus was passing and started shouting at the top of his voice.\r\n\r\n\"And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging; and hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant and they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by, and he cried saying, Jesus thou son of David, have mercy on me. And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more,Thou the son of David, have mercy on me, and Jesus stood and commanded him to be brought unto him; and when he come near, he asked him, saying what wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight. And Jesus said unto him receive thy sight thy faith hath saved thee. And immediately he receives his sight, and followed him glorying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.\" Luke 18:35-43\r\n\r\nIt was the uncommon noise of faith that came out of that blind man\'s mouth that made Jesus to stop to attend to his case, and not just the ordinary and common noise of the crowd around there. What a great God!\r\n\r\nThere is no amount of tears you shed during your prayer or moments of challenges that can move or provoke God to do something in your life, but your faith.\r\n\r\nPeople that were following Jesus were very many. And you will agree with me that there was no way they would be following Him without talking. But the shout of faith of the blind man overshadowed the cacophony of voices or noise of the crowd; and it was only his own voice, borne out of strong faith that Jesus heard. The request of the blind man was immediately attended to and granted by Jesus. It was indeed an uncommon display of faith.\r\n\r\nMany Christians are at the edge of their miracle or breakthrough, but they lack the faith to grab it. \"For we walk by faith, not by sight.\" 2 Cor. 5:7\r\n\r\nMany people see the great plans of God for their lives in their dreams, but these cannot come into reality due to their lack of faith.\r\nA minister of the Gospel came to me one day and told me that God had instructed him to go to a certain place for an assignment. I congratulated him for receiving the purpose of God for his life. But he said, what actually brought him to me was that he needed some money to start the assignment. And I told him that when God told Abraham to leave his father\'s house and relations to a certain place, He showed him where to go, but did not give him anything. I told him to take a step of faith and go to wherever God has directed him. But it was quite unfortunate he was not willing to go, but looking for someone that would give him money to start up the assignment.\r\n\r\nTake it or leave it, God cannot give you money to start His assignment. The only thing you need is your faith.\r\n\r\nWhat God did in my ministry and marriage has really made me to stand firm in my faith in Him. Based on my faith, He has been faithful to me all the way. When I started the ministry, I had no imoney. When it was time for me to get married, I had nothing also. But my unwavering faith in God has been of great help to make all things possible for me.\r\n\r\nMany detractive suggestions and pieces of advice came from different quarters in order to discourage me, but my faith kept on telling me that all things were possible in God.\r\n\r\nAnd to God be the glory, I am overwhelmed with visible testimonies today. Fasting and prayer are good spiritual activities, only if faith is involved to channel it to the throne of God. \"And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but believe that those thing which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, what thing so ever ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye receive them and he shall have them. \"Mark 11:22-24\r\n\r\nSpiritual activities are good and yield positive results, provided faith is at work. But in a situation where faith is absent, everything will be an exercise in futility.\r\n\r\nOur faith is the carrier of our desires to God. Let me share an experience with you. When I needed to buy a land to build the church to start this ministry, I did not have money. All the same, I had a meeting with the people that wanted to sell a plot of land that was worth millions of naira at the time. A man came with cash to buy the land, but my faith turned his plan upside down, that even with his money he could not get the land. Do you know why? It was because God was moved with the faith I exercised. Despite several attempts by people from different places to buy the land, to the glory of God and surprise of many people, my faith made it possible for us to acquire the land.\r\n\r\nYour years in the church or weeping over challenges cannot move God. It is nothing but your faith that can provoke God to answer your prayer. Your faith can break the strictest protocol and open doors for you. \"Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? Mine hour is not yet come.\" John 2:4\r\n\r\nThe mother of Jesus knew quite well that if the case of the finished wine should be presented to Jesus, something positive would definitely happen. She had absolute faith that if the case could get to Jesus, wine would be available. It was not the right time as Jesus rightly remarked, but faith broke the protocol. I pray your faith will break every protocol or obstacle standing against your fulfillment in Jesus\' name.\r\n\r\nBegin to operate in faith and not in fake practice of religion from now. God only understands your faith and not your noise when you ask anything from Him.\r\n\r\n\"If your faith does not come from the Word of God, you can never receive anything from Him.\"', 'The Word\r\n\r\n\"So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.\" Romans 10:17\r\n\r\nThe Scripture here makes us to understand that the Word of God is the source and strength of faith. In other words, without the Word, there will be no faith.\r\n\r\nIt surprises me at times seeing how some Christians are far from the Word of God, and yet claiming that they have faith. I don\'t know the basis of their faith. Faith without the Word of God is fake and useless.\r\n\r\nI have said it earlier that faith is not a religious logic, but a spiritual weapon that makes the impossible to be possible, for every believer that operates through faith.\r\n\r\nThe Word of God is the backbone of faith. \"I will worship towards thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy loving kindness and for thy truth: for thou magnified thy word above all thy name.\" Psalm 138:2\r\n\r\nGod magnifies His Word above His name. And it\'s the same Word that gives birth to faith. If your faith does not come from the Word of God, you can never receive anything from Him.\r\n\r\nMany are not serious with Bible study in the church and yet expect God to do wonders in their lives. It is more ridiculous that some churches disregard Bible study and yet they desire God\'s blessings upon their ministries by faith. It is impossible!\r\n\r\nAny church that jokes with the Word of God can never receive any miracle from God.\r\n\r\nMany Christians have the Bible, but lack the good knowledge of the Word inside it. It\'s not just having the Bible that matters, but careful and constant reading of it, in order to have good understanding of the Word of God.\r\n\r\nEvery situation in life is inside the Bible, if only you can create time to read it.\r\n\r\nSome ministers in the church are too busy to read the Bible, but expect miracles to happen in their prayer meetings. They celebrate the years spent in the ministry, but are yet to celebrate what faith has done in their lives.\r\n\r\nAfter reading the Word of God, what should come next is meditation. It is a God-ordained way to study His word effectively. It is one thing to read the Bible, but another thing to meditate on what you have read. Meditation is careful and deep thinking of what you have read in the Holy Spirit is the greatest teacher that teaches you how to meditate on the Word. \"But the comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\" John 14:26\r\n\r\nAs a believer, you need the ministry of the Holy Spirit in your life in order to understand the things of the spirit.\r\n\r\nAgain, let\'s also look at revelation. After meditation, what follows is revelation. Revelation is the unveiling to man those things that we cannot discover through our own efforts by God. And this can only be derived from the Word of God, through the power of the Holy\r\n\r\nSpirit.\r\n\r\nIt was the revelation I discovered from the book of Nehemiah in the Bible that helped me to build our first church.\r\n\r\nYou also need spiritual eyes. \"And the Lord said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look the place where thou art northward and southward, and eastward, and westward. For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed forever.\" Genesis 13:14 15.\r\nJust consider what God told Abraham in the above Scripture; that as far as he could see, so shall he be given. So it means, it is the level of your faith that will determine the blessings you will receive from God.\r\n\r\nWhen God asked Prophet Jeremiah what he saw, he answered God that he could see a rod of an almond tree. And God declared He would bring to pass what Jeremiah had seen, because he saw the correct thing. \"Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Jer-mi\'ah, what seeth thou? And I said I see a rod of almond tree, then said the Lord unto me. Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it.\" Jeremiah 1:11-12.\r\nYou need spiritual eyes to see your promotion, breakthrough, marriage, baby, new car etc. What you see is what you will receive. As a matter of fact, I have never seen a farmer that planted corn and harvested yam. It is Impossible. What you see matters to your miracle, based on your faith.\r\n\r\nOne thing happened to me many years back. At a time, I declared by faith that I would know how to drive a car before the age of 24. And what I declared and foresaw through faith at that time eventually came to pass. But assuming I have said I would own a car at that age also, nothing could have changed it; I would have become a car owner as well. Never mind your present situation, but what your faith is seeing concerning you. \"I can do all things through Christ that strengthen me.\" Philippians 4:13\r\n\r\nApostle Paul saw himself as being able to do all things through Christ. What you don\'t see, you cannot possess. You have to see with faith, before you can get it.\r\n\r\nIt is the level of your faith based on what you are seeing about yourself or that situation that will provoke God to answer you. Please, I beg you in the name of Jesus; begin to see good things about yourself from now on.\r\n\r\nJust like spiritual eyes, your mouth is also important. \"Say to them, as Ilive, says the Lord, Just as you have spoken in my hearing, so I will do to you.\" Num. 14:28, The mouth of a believer is the announcer of his or her faith. It\'s very important for every believer to utter good things all the time.\r\n\r\nThe Word\r\n\r\nGod sent Moses to the people of Israel, that whatever they declared from their mouth was what he would do to them. No wonder why many of them couldn\'t get to the Promised Land, due to what they declared negatively from their mouth.\r\n\r\nDeclaration will determine the strength of your faith. And your positive declaration goes a long way to weaken the power of the kingdom of darkness against you.\r\nNever mind what you are facing at the moment. Keep on declaring positive things about your situation. Don\'t stop saying it and I can assure you that you shall surely overcome it.\r\n\r\nI pray that God will grant you special grace to see and say good things about yourself in Jesus\' name.\r\n\r\n\"The heart of man is the house that contains faith\"', 'Heart OF MAN\r\n\r\nT he heart is a very important organ of the body that makes us a living being so far it is still functioning. In the spiritual realm, it\'s the seat of faith. Faith settles in the heart of man.\r\n\r\nDon\'t forget that knowledge enters the heart while faith comes from the knowledge acquired. Faith cannot develop in man without the heart of man. Faith that develops from the heart moves to the body and the body then puts it into practice, while the spirit illuminates it.\r\n\r\nAnyone that wants to enjoy the blessings of faith must jealously guide his or her heart against worldly or ungodly things. \"Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of spring the issue of life.\" Proverb 4:23\r\n\r\nWhatever you are expecting God to do in your life through faith, you must protect your heart against any worldliness, because this will stand against any spiritual assignment in your heart.\r\n\r\nBoth God\'s still small voice and Satan\'s loud and tempting voice, struggle to win the heart of man. Reading the Bible and meditating on it will help a lot to purify the heart against every satanic assignment. \"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus\" Philippians 2:5\r\n\r\nApostle Paul here makes us to understand that we need to possess the heart that Christ possessed, which was the mind of God. Everyone that possesses the heart of God has the heart of faith.\r\n\r\nThe heart of man is one of the strength of faith. Faith cannot operate successfully without the heart of man. \"For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee.\" Proverb 23:7\r\n\r\nThis Scripture makes us to understand that as you think or imagine in your heart, so shall it happen to you..\r\n\r\nYour mouth might be declaring faith, while your heart is standing against your declaration. Your heart is the mother to what your mouth confesses. \"Brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good things, and an evil man out of his evil treasure brings forth evil things.\" Mathew 12:34-35\r\n\r\nIf your heart is occupied with unclean and ungodly things, then you should not expect faith to work for you, because it is your heart that determines the strength of faith that you declare with your mouth. So always beware of what you deposit in your heart.\r\n\r\nYour heart has a significant and indispensable role to play before faith can deliver your desired result. Your faith must come from God\'s knowledge and settle in your heart.\r\nMany people in the church today join others in confessing good things with their mouth, but then it does not come from their heart.\r\n\r\nThere was no rain for a very long time in a village. So the prayer warriors in a particular church in the village decided to go to a mountain to pray so that God could give them rain. They agreed to go to the mountain and expressed this with their mouth but not with their heart. But there was a man among them that had faith and agreed with both his mouth and heart. He followed them to the mountain with his umbrella, believing that the prayer would surely bring rain. Others criticized him for taking an umbrella along with him to the mountain. But he stood his ground based on his faith that it was going to rain after the prayer and therefore went with the umbrella. On getting to the mountain, they prayed and God answered them. Rain fell heavily and they began to scramble for the man\'s umbrella with him.\r\n\r\nDoes your faith begin from your heart or not? You can still correct your ways from today. Faith has nothing to do with age. If your child applies or understands faith more than you, he will definitely enjoy its blessings more than you do.\r\n\r\nYour heart is a great pillar to your faith. As the pillar is very important to every building, so is the heart very essential to faith.\r\n\r\nThe heart of man is the house that contains faith. Guide it against any evil contamination or assignment.\r\n\r\n\"God is ever in the prayer room looking for someone who can utter a prayer of faith.\"', 'Effective PRAYER\r\n\r\nNothing can be achieved without prayer. And faith is powerless without prayer. Faith and prayer go hand in hand. No matter how you pray, if faith is not demonstrated, you cannot receive anything from God. \"So Jesus answered and said to them, have faith in God. For assuredly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain be removed and cast into the sea; and doesn\'t doubt in his heart, but believes that those things he says will come to pass; he will have whatever he says. Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray believe that you receive them, and you will have them.\" Mark 11:22-24\r\n\r\nYour prayer must go with your faith for you to\r\n\r\nachieve unchangeable and outstanding results.\r\n\r\nWhat does it mean to pray? It is an act of communicating with God or presenting your desires to Him. And this has started right from the Old Testament. \"And as for Seth, to him also a son was born; and named him Enos. Then men began to call on the name of the Lord.\" Genesis 4:26. So prayer didn\'t just start in our generation, but generations before you and me started to exist.\r\n\r\nPrayer is compulsory to every believer. There is no one that is above prayer; whether you are a prophet, general overseer or apostle. You have to pray before your faith will get a place to operate.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, prayer should not be a seasonal thing, but something that must be part and parcel of every living person. And because the needs of man are numerous, prayer must be made a daily exercise.\r\nEvery believer must pray till he or she dies. Death is the only thing that can stop man from praying. Prayer is a great force that motivates faith and gives power to it to operate very well. But praying without faith is a waste of time and energy, as the two must work together towards fulfillment. \"And in that day you will ask Me nothing. Most assuredly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in my name He will give you. Until now you have asked nothing in my name, Ask and you will receive, that you joy may be full. \"John 16:23-24.\r\n\r\nAs it is often said; our God is ever in the prayer room looking for someone who can utter a prayer of faith.\r\n\r\nThe Scripture says; ask till your joy is full. The joy derived from your prayer is a special assignment of faith to ensure your fulfillment.\r\n\r\nPrayer is one of the backbones and pillars of faith. It creates a platform for faith to work. So invariably, prayer is a substance that must first take place, before faith can be demonstrated.\r\n\r\n\"Thus also faith by itself, if it doesn\'t have work, is dead. But someone will say, you have faith and I have work. Show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works. You believe that there is no God. You do well, even the demons believe -and tremble! But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without work is dead.\" James 2:17-20\r\n\r\nPrayer is work. And it is the only thing that can make your faith effective. But before your faith, you must first engage in prayer.\r\n\r\nWhen you pray, always ensure the substance of your prayer is biblical. Whoever that offers an unbiblical prayer cannot receive an answer from God and by so doing his or her faith becomes powerless.\r\nLet your faith move with a scriptural prayer and God will be provoked to answer you. I pray your faith will deliver good results to you in Jesus\' Name.\r\n\r\n\"Fruits are the beauty of a tree and faith without a fruit is useless.\"', 'The Fruits OF FAITH\r\n\r\nAs we have fruits of the spirit, so does faith has its own fruits also that make it outstandingly good. Fruits are the beauty of a tree and faith without a fruit is useless.\r\n\r\nThe following are the fruits of faith:\r\n\r\n1. LOVE: Every man of faith must possess the genuine love of God in his heart. Faith without the love of God is nothing. The reason why you must love is because God Himself is love.\r\n\r\n\"Behold, let us love one another: for love is of God; and everyone that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.\" 1 John 4:7-8. Any man of faith is a man of love.\r\n\r\n2. HOPE: This is a spiritual expectation that can never fail. But the natural hope of man either in someone or something can always disappoint. A man of faith swims in the ocean of hope all the time. \"And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.\" Romans 5:5\r\n\r\nAbraham and Sarah were good examples of hope. Their natural hope was dead, but the spiritual hope made the impossible to be possible in their lives.\r\n\r\n3. PATIENCE: Everyone who has faith must cultivate the spirit of patience towards his or her request or prayer to God. It is not as if God cannot do that which you have requested, but you have to wait patiently for the manifestation of your miracle. \"And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulations worketh patience; and patience, experience and experience, hope.\" Romans 5:3-4. Any patient Christian will always receive a perfect gift from God through the power of faith.\r\n4. CONFIDENCE: Effective faith demands full confidence in the Lord. It is true that with God all things are possible, but only for them that believe and are confident in the Word. \"But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, with men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.\" Mathew 19:26. With the confidence you have in God, you can convert the impossibilities of this world to possibilities. \"Cast not away your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.\" Hebrews 10:35. The confidence that you exude in the Lord will facilitate a great reward of blessings to your life and to your faltering faith.\r\n5. PEACE: Faith that is operating outside the peace of Christ Jesus cannot deliver anything but anxieties and worries. Effective faith swims in the river of peace and whatever you ask God to do will surely be granted. \"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.\" Romans 5:1. After exercising faith, the next thing is to enjoy the peace of God in Christ Jesus. Your faith is not complete when this is absent.\r\n\r\n6. JOY: Everyone who exercises faith must dwell in the garden of God\'s joy. \"Rejoice in the Lord always; and again I say Rejoice.\" Philippians 4:4. The joy of the Lord is very essential to every man of faith.\r\n\r\nAll the fruits mentioned above have a lot to do in strengthening faith. You cannot be a man of faith without possessing all these fruits. Special grace to be a man of faith will come upon you in Jesus\' name. Amen\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, before you can be qualified to be called a man or woman of faith, you must have passed through the school of salvation. Faith cannot work for someone that hasn\'t experienced salvation. \"For God so love the world, that he gave only His begotten Son, that whoever believeth in Him shall not perish, but has an external life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.\" John 3:16-17\r\n\r\nGod showed His love towards mankind by sending His only begotten Son to the world of tribulations to die for our sins.\r\n\r\nJesus came to the world because of you and me, to deliver us from sin and Satan. He doesn\'t need your money or material wealth. All He\'s asking for is your heart. \"But God commendeth his love towards us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ die for us.\" Romans 5:8\r\n\r\nWhen we were yet sinners, Christ surrendered His life for you and me. And therefore, you have to give your life to Him. \"But as many that received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe his name.\" John 1:12\r\n\r\nWhosoever that surrenders his or her life to Jesus shall be empowered and become the son and daughter of God. And such a person\'s name shall be written in the book of life.\r\n\r\nJesus loves you and He is knocking at the door of your heart right now. Allow Him to come into your life and you shall never remain the same again. There is no way faith can work for you without experiencing salvation.\r\n\r\nThe standards of faith are not negotiable. All that is required of you is to follow the rules that govern it.\r\n\r\nYou must first be a child of God before faith can begin to work for you. Again, faith is not a religious logic, but a spiritual weapon that makes the impossible to be possible in the lives of those that possess it.\r\n\r\nDon\'t also forget that faith is a mystery of God in itself and not a risk taking venture. As you take steps to consider the pillars of faith being mentioned in this book in order to strengthen your faith, I pray you will have outstanding testimonies in Jesus mighty name. Amen.', '', '', '', '', '', 'ziggyadex@gmail.com', '2023-05-23', '');

Why? It\'s because man came from God that is great and wonderful in success. Success is part of man\'s attributes.\r\nGod is a God of success in every area imaginable. And He expects every person to succeed in all areas of life. When God embarked on creation, He succeeded from the beginning to the end.\r\n\"And God saw everything that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.\"Genesis 1 vs. 31\r\nIn this context, God started well and had a pleasant\r\nconclusion. He achieved good success on the task of creation. Whoever that finds it difficult to succeed may be engaging in what is contrary to the purpose or will of God, as He desires success for you anytime any day. Go for success and not failure. There is no failure in God but in Satan. Whatever challenges you are facing on the way to success, they are just transient; they will come and definitely go. Don\'t use your mouth to attract negative things against yourself.\r\nJust because God told you to do a thing does not mean you will not encounter challenges on the way. \"For a great door and effectual is opened unto me and there are many adversaries.\" 1 Corinthians 16 vs.9\r\nTruly, a door of great success is open unto you, but at the same time Satan will attack you in order to get you distracted from the road of success. If you are in such a situation right now, what does God expect you to do? Of course, it is to rise up and fight it out.\r\n\"Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Armon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, King of Heshbon, and his land: begin to posses it and contend with him in battle.\"Deut. 2 vs.24\r\nSomeone once said \'success is an adventure\'. You have to stand and fight it out. A quitter they say never wins and a winner never quits. Keep on fighting it to the point of success.\r\nSuccess is your portion; go for it and not failure. God succeeded and you as His child must succeed. I pray you will succeed in Jesus Christ name. Amen', 'Copyright Â© 2014, Pastor T. J.

It could also mean the natural or special ability to do something. It helps one to carry out an assignment.\r\nThere are two types of power. One is physical power and the other is spiritual power. The physical power can be exercised in different ways. As earlier mentioned, power could be the right to control or influence people, most times by a higher authority. A president of a nation, for instance may use his power to issue an order to the entire nation. Whether you are his friend, neighbour or relation, you must obey his order, because it came from the above. You can call that political power.\r\nSpiritual power on the other hand is the power that operates with spiritual mean sin two different ways; the power of Satan and the power of the Almighty God. Both of these work in the spiritual realm.\r\nThe power of God, however supersedes the power of Satan. Satanic power can fail but the power of God does not fail. God the father, the Son and the Holy Spirit came in human form to demonstrate this power. The power operates both in heaven and on earth.\r\n\"And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth\" Matthew 28 vs.18. \r\nThe power of God is the secret behind the success of God on earth and in heaven. Without this power nothing can be done successfully both in heaven and on earth. In other words, the power of God is indispensable to anyone that desires good success. As significant as power is, so also can no man have joy in his life without success. For you to succeed in life, therefore, you need the power of God.\r\nWHAT IS SUCCESS?\r\nSuccess is having favourable outcome or achieving desired goal or result. Everybody that has a goal wants to succeed; but not everyone that sets a goal achieves it. Due to challenges people face before they succeed, it\'s not everyone that can face these and overcome. The race is not made for the mighty, but people that understand the principles and follow them.\r\n\"This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.\"Joshua 1 vs. 8\r\nJoshua understood the principles and he succeeded to the Promised Land. You need to know and understand the principles of success before you can succeed in life. Many wish to succeed, but lack the principles that guide success. It is God\'s pleasure and desire for you to succeed, if only you can follow what has been written in the Scriptures regarding success. There are two types of success. One is bad success while the other one is good success.\r\nBad Success: This is the success people of the world usually recognize. Satan is its source and it\'s full of evil acts.\r\n\"As the partridge sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not; so he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool\". Jeremiah 17 vs.11 People who achieve bad success measure their own success by materials abundance. What they measure in this case is not success, but reward of success. Some acquire material things through all kinds of devilish means e.g. bribery, corruption, fraud, robbery, among other vices. Whatever they acquire through any of these is often used as a yardstick to measure their success. It is absolutely not success in the real sense, but a mere shadow of success.\r\n\"The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city\". Eccl 10 vs. 15.\r\nBad success attracts sorrow, weeping and sudden death.\r\nGood Success: This is the success that originates from God and has Him as its source. Good success is the pursuit of God\'s purpose for your life and elicits God\'s pleasure.\r\n\"Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.\" Psalms 16 vs.1 \r\n\"And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.\"Acts 22 vs. 10.\r\nWhere good success is achieved, there\'s no room for sorrow or weeping, but the joy of the Lord.\r\n\"Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the LORD is your strength.\"Nehemiah 8 vs. 10\r\nWhen Nehemiah succeeded in his assignment, the people were full of the joy of the Lord, because it was God\'s purpose for their lives so they succeeded.\r\n\"But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother\'s womb, and called me by his grace,\" Galatians 1 vs.15.\r\nI pray that, if you follow God\'s purpose for your life, you will succeed in life in Jesus name. \r\n\"And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father\'s business? Luke 2 vs. 49.\r\nOur Lord Jesus was after His father\'s purpose for His life and so He achieved success in His ministry. You are a child of a successful God. Whatever is required of you to succeed in your goal, receive the grace in Jesus name.\r\nSource of good success\r\nOf course God is the source of good success. Anything called success that is not from God is not success. Every success that has God\'s connection must have the following three characteristics:\r\ni. Peace\r\nii. Everlasting\r\nlii. Sorrow-free\r\ni. Peace it is what you cannot buy with money. No matter how wealthy you may be, peace is not what you can use your wealth or personality to acquire. God is the source of peace. Whether you are rich or not, once you follow the ways of God, you are sure of God\'s peace.\r\n\"To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.\" Romans 1 vs. 7 God is the giver of peace. The success that comes from God is full of peace.\r\n\"For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end..\" Jeremiah 29 vs. 11\r\nii. Everlasting Another thing that confirms good success is that, it is everlasting. I mean it is always durable and nothing on earth can erode it away because it comes from God, who is the source. And as God liveth, your success which takes its root from God will be everlasting in Jesus name.\r\niii. Sorrow-free Every blessing that comes from God adds no sorrow but full of joy and pleasure.\r\n\"The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.\" Proverbs 10 vs.22 The thoughts of God towards His people are thoughts of good success and not failure.\r\n\"This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.\"Joshua 1 vs. 8\r\n\"I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him. Eccl. 3 vs. 14,\r\n\"Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.\" Job 22 vs. 21.\r\nSuccess is possible anywhere so long you are in the Lord. It\'s not restricted or confined to any particular place.', 'LOCATING GOD\'S PLAN\r\nAnyone who desires success must understand the plan of God for his life. It\'s your understanding of God\'s plans for your life that will determine your success.\r\n\"And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.\"Genesis 12 vs. 1-4.\r\nIt was the plan of God for Abraham that helped him to succeed in life. Consider the case of the children\r\nof Israel; they left Egypt for the Promised Land and at\r\nthe end of the journey, they achieved success. King David also followed the plan of God for his life and in the end he succeeded.\r\n\"Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.\r\nAnd Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.\r\nAnd he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.\r\nThen Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.\r\nBut the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him1Samuel 16 vs. 10 14.\r\nThe Bible says in the book of Psalms 32 vs. 8 9; \"I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye. Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.\" God has a plan for you on earth, only if you can discover the plan, is when you are sure of success in life. Many embark on what God does not ask them to do and expect to succeed. As a matter of fact, they cannot achieve success. Anything that has God\'s influence guarantees success and is sorrow-free.\r\n\"So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also. Romans 1 vs.15.\r\nWhoever discovers the will of God for his life will experience no stress, nor will any principality or power overcome him. If you want to enjoy your journey in this world, you need to locate the plan of God for your life.\r\n\"And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father\'s business? Luke 2 vs. 49.\r\nThere are ways you can discover or locate the plans of God for your life\r\n\r\n1. Prayer: This is a way of communicating with God. You can locate the plans of God for your life through prayer and fasting.\r\n\"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?\r\nIf ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him? Matthew 7 vs. 7 11.\r\nGod will surely answer whatever you ask Him in prayer. He said, \"Ask and you shall be given, knock, it shall be open unto you, and also seek, you shall find\". This clearly demonstrates that if only you can pray, God is ever ready to answer and show you His plans for your life.\r\nThe importance of prayer to the Gospel cannot be over emphasized. It\'s indispensable to every believer, because God is always in the prayer room looking for someone that can pray. If truly you want God to show you your purpose on earth, then engage in prayer. No one prays with genuine mind and gets disappointed. Some would say, they pray and do not receive any answer from God. Why? It is simple. It\'s either their prayers are not rooted in God\'s Word or they do not pray according to the will of God. Such a prayer will never receive any answer from God. Your prayer must go hand-in-hand with the will of God and not your own personal will. Whenever you are set to pray, you must believe that God will answer your prayer; because many often pray without having faith in God. \r\n\"And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What things so ever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.\" Mark 11 vs. 2224\r\nFaith is a spiritual legal tender required to provoke God to answer a prayer. Any prayer without faith cannot achieve anything. Your prayer to God must go along with your faith. Prayer is an avenue to communicate with your Creator.\r\n\r\n2. Natural talent:\r\n\"And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey. Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents. And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two. But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord\'s money. After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them. And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.\" Matthew 25 vs. 15 20.\r\nEvery human is given one or more talents by God. You can also discover God\'s plan for your life through your God-given talent. In that book of Matthew, God gave out talents to some people. He gave five to one person; two to the second man and the remaining one talent to the last person to trade with and make profits.\r\nOne\'s natural talent is an easy way for anyone that wants to know the plan of God for his life. King David discovered the talent of God for his life. He was a singer and warrior. He used to sing to relieve King Saul from an evil spirit that often tormented him.\r\n\"And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him. \"1Samuel 16 vs. 23\r\nHis musical talent made this possible. He also delivered the people of Israel from the Philistine, their enemy that waged war against them.\r\n\"And David said to Saul, Let no man\'s heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine. And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth. And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father\'s sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock: And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.\" 1Samuel 17 vs. 32 35.\r\nGod delivered the Israelites from their enemy, through the military talent of David. You can discover God\'s plan for your life through your talent. I pray, as you take steps to know the plan of God for your life, God will answer you in Jesus name. Knowing God\'s plan for your life will surely guarantee your success.\r\n3. Your hobbies: \"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest\". Eccl. 9 vs. 10.\r\nYour decent and godly hobbies or whatever you love and derive joy doing might be God\'s plan for you. If there\'s anything you are doing that does not bring joy or make someone happy, could cause sorrow or ill-health. What you are doing that gives you joy would definitely encourage you to do more and this might be God\'s plan for your life.', 'REQUIREMENTS FOR SUCCESS\r\nThere are certain requirements that make success a reality. If you follow these requirements, success is guaranteed. The requirements are as follows:\r\ni. Study the Bible and other relevant books: If you earnestly desire good success, you must cultivate the habit of reading the Word of God and other relevant Christian books. A man said, \"a good reader is a good leader\"\r\n\"Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.\"2 Timothy 2 vs. 15. God even told Joshua before he started his assignment, that he should not play with the books of the law, by studying them day and night.\r\n\"This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.\"Joshua 1 vs. 8\r\nThank God for Joshua; he complied with what the instruction of God. By studying the Word of God, he succeeded and became great in life.\r\nThe Word of God is not like other books in the world, as it carries the fullness of God.\r\n\"It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.\"John 6 vs. 63.\r\nEven God Himself magnified His Word above His name.\r\n\"I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy loving kindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.\" Psalms 138 vs. 2\r\nGod places His Word higher than every other thing both on earth and in heaven. The Word of God is powerful than anything.\r\n\"For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.\"Hebrews 4 vs. 12 The Word is sharper than a sword that cut things\r\ninto pieces. Whoever that makes good use of the\r\nWord of God, will surely succeed in life.\r\nSome relevant Christian books, written by inspired children of God, would break down the Word of God to the level that people can understand. The more you read these books, the more you acquire more relevant and beneficial information as well as understanding and wisdom. The Bible and these books are practical illuminations that take away darkness and ignorance.\r\nii. Mouth: Your mouth is a major requirement for good success. You confess with your mouth whatever you desire to become. The mouth plays a vital role in life. Even God told the people of Israel that whatever they said to Him would He do for them.\r\n\"Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you: Numbers 14 vs. 28.\r\nA man said, \'What you confess to yourself is very important to your future\'. Mind what you utter with your mouth especially to yourself. A man once told me there was a day he lied to his colleagues in his office that he had a motor accident. He gave that as the reason he could not come to work that day. Unfortunately for him, he had an accident that same day he told the lie. Mind your tongue; it is better to use it to confess positive and not negative things about yourself.\r\n\"When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?\r\nAnd they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. \"Matthew 16 vs. 13-16\r\nYour mouth is the seal of your Christian faith.\r\n\"For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.\" Romans 10 vs.10.\r\nThe Bible stands on whatever you confess to confirm your salvation. Also your mouth is a tool to decree life or death; success or failure upon your life \"Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.\"Proverbs 18 vs.21.\r\nWhat you confess will determine what you will become in life, because there is power in the word that comes out of your mouth. Be conscious of what you confess with your mouth.\r\n\"Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong\"Joel 3 vs. 10\r\nMany are sick, for example, and instead of uttering positive things with their mouth to make them recover from the sickness, they will be saying negative things to themselves. Watch your mouth. Mouth is a two-edged sword of life and death; sweetness and bitterness. Your mouth is very essential to your success. Always confess good things. \r\nWhatever you confess with your mouth will always attract the attention of an angel assigned to carry it out. Angels work on any instruction that comes out of your mouth.\r\n\"Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation? Heb.1 vs.14.\r\nAngels are spiritual writers that write whatever you confess with your mouth.\r\n\"Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands? Ecclesiastes 5 vs. 6.\r\nAngels are always with you to work on what you confess. They are agent of confessions. So watch your mouth.\r\niii. Meditation: This entails pondering or thinking seriously and deeply about something. God told Joshua to read and meditate on the book of the law given to him. Meditation enhances a full and clear pitture of what you read and gives a spiritual insight to your goal. It was the imagination of Nehemiah that helped him to succeed in the construction of the wall of Jerusalem.\r\n\"And I said unto the king. If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers\' sepulchres, that I may build it.\" Nehemiah 2 vs. 5\r\nIn other words, Nehemiah meditated on the plan and succeeded. Meditation makes what is invisible to be visible. Before the creation of the heaven and earth, it was a thought that first went through the mind of God. Meditation is very powerful in the realm of success and helps to generate invisible energy for accomplishment of goals. It also allows you to rub mind with greater minds.\r\niv. Observation: The principle or ability to learn is through observation. was throughan, observation of Daniel that made him to understand that they would spend severity years in the foreign land.\r\n\"In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;\r\n2 in the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.\"Daniel 9 vs. 1-2.\r\nAnyone who lacks observation will not achieve anything in life. Jesus also told His Disciples to be observant before praying.\r\n\"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. \"Matthew 26 vs. 41.\r\nObservation helps to discover facts and truth about something you desire to achieve. \r\nv. Be an obedient servant: The level of your obedience will determine your success in life.\r\n\"And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that the LORD thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth:\r\nAnd all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God. Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field.\r\nBlessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.\r\nBlessed shall be thy basket and thy store. Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out. The LORD shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face: they shall come out against thee one way, and flee before thee seven ways. The LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses, and in all that thou settest thine hand unto; and he shall bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.\r\nThe LORD shall establish thee an holy people unto himself, as he hath sworn unto thee, if thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, and walk in his ways. And all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the LORD; and they shall be afraid of thee. And the LORD shall make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers to give thee. The LORD shall open unto thee his good treasure, the heaven to give the rain unto thy land in his season, and to bless all the work of thine hand: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, and thou shalt not borrow.\r\nAnd the LORD shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the LORD thy God, which I command thee this day, to observe and to do them: And thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command thee this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to go after other gods serve them. \"Deteronomy 28 vs. 1-14\r\nYour obedience to the Word of God will help you to enjoy the benefits of the Gospel. It makes success come cheap, without sweat. It was the obedience of Abraham that made him a great man and the father of many nations.\r\n\"And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:\r\nThat in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;\r\nAnd in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.\" Gen. 22 vs. 16-18\r\nWhere is your obedience? For anyone that is determined to succeed in life, I pray that God will grant you grace to be obedient unto Him in Jesus name. Amen. No obedience, no good success as the two go hand-in-hand.', 'METHODS OF SUCCESS\r\nA purpose without pursuit is powerless and cannot lead to fulfillment. And so also is purpose and pursuit without method, I mean a strategy to carry it out will give birth to confusion. The following are the methods of making your success a reality:\r\nI. Relevant information: The importance of\r\nright information to good success is indisputable. Information is a roadmap that will show you where to go and how to go about it. Therefore, without the right information, there will be no success.\r\nMy people are destroyed for lack of knowledge Hosea 4 vs. 6.\r\nIt was the relevant information that Nehemiah gathered that helped him to build the wall of Jerusalem.\r\n\"And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldst send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers\' sepulchres, that I may build it. And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and set him a time.\r\nMoreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah;\r\nAnd a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king\'s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.\r\nThen I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king\'s letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.\r\nWhen Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel. So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.\r\nAnd I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.\r\nAnd I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire. \r\nThen I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king\'s pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.\r\nThen went I up in the night by the brook, and wewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so returned..Nehemiah 2 vs. 5-15.\r\nGod can only show you what you will become, but He will not plan for you. You are to do the planning by yourself. It was Nehemiah that did the planning by himself with his other colleagues.\r\nii. Wisdom: Wisdom means the application of the relevant facts gathered through knowledge acquired. It is also the use of the available to actualize a goal.\r\n\"Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding. \"Proverbs 4 vs. 7.\r\nWisdom is a great treasure to anyone that has the grace to have it. It makes one\'s journey sweat-free. \"He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy is he.\" Proverbs 16 vs. 20.\r\nIt will help you to handle your goal wisely without any distraction. There are three types of wisdom; satanic wisdom, intellectual wisdom and divine wisdom. Divine wisdom, which is the wisdom of God, is the best for anyone that wants to succeed in his goal in life. There are four ways to acquire divine wisdom:\r\na) You can acquire the wisdom of God through prayer.\r\n\"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\" James 1 vs. 5\r\nb) You can receive the wisdom through the Word of God.\r\nc) Through the fear of the Lord.\r\n\"The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.\"\r\nProverbs 9 vs. 10\r\nd) Moving with the wise.\r\n\"He that wolketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.\"Proverbs 13 vs. 20\r\nIf you seek the wisdom of God through these ways you are sure of having it. It delivers victory, success and breakthrough to you cheaply. Get the wisdom of God if truly you want to achieve your goal. Embrace it and it will make your life colourful.\r\niii.Discipline: This is self-control or ability to control yourself. Many temptations will come your way if you aspire to succeed. All you need to do is to discipline yourself. Indiscipline is a way of getting you distracted by the devil. \r\n\"Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.\" 1Corinthians 9 vs. 24-25,\r\nAnyone that is running a race should not allow indiscipline to get him distracted from the race of glory.\r\nThe devil knows what will be the end of your goal and because of that, he will like to distract you not to achieve that goal. Self-discipline is the weapon that can destroy Satan\'s plans against you. Give room to discipline.\r\niv. Diligence: This is hard work in the right direction. Many are very diligent in one field or the other, but not in the right direction.\r\n\"Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.\" Proverbs 22 vs.29.\r\nOur God in heaven is busy working seriously and it is expected of you to be busy working in any area He has placed you. Diligence in the right, godly direction will guarantee you good success. Hard work produces three powerful blessings.\r\na. It generates good success b. It takes someone to a great height\r\nC. It guarantees good sleep.\r\n\"The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.\"Eccl. 5 vs. 12\r\ni. Good company: No matter how powerful you are, you need other men and women to fulfill your assignment. There is no one that can be a \'master of all. One man will have a vision, but majority will help interpret the vision. People like Abraham, Moses, Joshua, David, even our Lord Jesus had people that supported them to fulfill their respective assignment.\r\n\"After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come. Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.\"Luke 10 vs. 1-2.\r\nThe places Jesus could not reach, He sent His Disciples there. The following are the benefits you can derive from good company.\r\na) Companionship Everyone needs somebody to share his feelings with.\r\n\"Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.\"Eccl. 4 vs. 9-10.\r\nWhere two or more walk together, they will share their feelings together.\r\nb) Good Counsel As the Scriptures say, two are better than one. If one is about to fall, the other would offer a helping hand by giving a good counsel, \"Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.\"Psalms 1 vs. 1', 'ARMOUR OF GOD\r\nBefore any soldier will go to the war front, he would have equipped himself with necessary weapons of war in order to overcome at the battle front. In a similar way, any child of God that wants to succeed in any particular goal in life must put on the armour of God.\r\n\"Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.\" Ephesians 6 vs. 11.\r\nAny progress you are planning to make in life, you must get yourself equipped; without that, the devil and his agents will not allow you to achieve it. I pray you will succeed your God given goal in Jesus name. Amen. The following are the armours of God.\r\n1) Prayer: Prayer is very essential as far as achieving success is concerned. Prayer is the master key that opens all doors. Whatever you are planning to do must be enforced with the power of prayer before you start it. Even when you have started it, you still need to pray further to achieve the goal. It is through prayer that you can discover the plans of God for your life; but even after the discovery, you still need prayer to start the race and end it successfully. Prayer is very essential to your success in life.\r\n\"For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.\" 1Corinthians 16\r\nvs. 9.\r\nTruly, God has a good plan for you, but don\'t forget that the very day you discover the plan of God for your life is the same day devil would start his ambush against your life.\r\n\"For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:2Corinthians 10 vs. 3.\r\nThe plans of God for you are visible but the attack of the enemy may not be visible. In such a situation, you need the support of God through prayer.\r\n\"And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me. \"Psalms 50 vs. 15.\r\nPrayer is part of the Armour of God that will help you to succeed in this world of tribulations.\r\nAnything you are planning to do in order to progress in life, you need the attention of God through prayer.\r\n\"Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. \"James 5 vs. 16.\r\nLet your prayer be a righteous prayer to God because God does not behold sin; as no sinner will see God. Every righteous prayer carries great power before God. Besides, let your prayer be rooted in God\'s Word. I mean establish your prayer with the Word of God. It will help you to pray according to the will of God. Any prayer you offer outside the will of God will not be answered.\r\nOur Lord Jesus succeeded on earth through the power of prayer. People of God, you cannot record success in your goal on earth without effective and fervent prayer. God will grant you the grace to cultivate the habit of offering effective prayer in Jesus name. Amen.\r\nIt was prayer that helped the Disciples of Christ to succeed in their assignments.\r\n\"By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus. And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness. And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common. And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all. Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,\" Acts 4 vs. 30-34.\r\nTheir prayer turned the whole world upside down and signs and wonders began to happen. They won more souls to the Kingdom of God and increased in number. Prayer opened unusual breakthroughs for them. You need prayer before you can succeed on earth. Prayer is a vital weapon to your success.\r\n2. Working faith: There is nothing you can do successfully in the Lord without faith. Faith is the money that is spent in heaven. So you cannot receive anything\r\n\"But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him\". Hebrews 11 vs. 6\r\nYou cannot receive any answer to your prayer if faith is not present. Faith is like the money we spend on earth. Without the legal tender called money, you cannot buy or sell anything in any earthly market. Your faith must be in place before you can get anything in God\'s market. The Scriptures say, it\'s impossible to please God without faith. Of course, faith makes your salvation to stand.\r\n\"For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:\" Ephesians 2 vs. 8. You are saved by grace through faith; which means faith is the highway that leads to salvation. Without\r\nfaith, there will be no salvation. \"For we walk by faith, not by sight. 2Corinthians 5 vs.7\r\nWhatever you want to do, you must know how to take steps of faith. Nothing is ready to work out, but faith makes them possible. Every successful man is a man of faith that makes things happen through faith.\r\nFaith is indispensible to anyone that desires success. It was faith of Abraham that helped his servant to discover a wife for Isaac.\r\n\"And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again. The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father\'s house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.\"Genesis 24 vs. 5-7.\r\nThe servant went and brought wife for Isaac. They\r\ndid not sit in a place without taking steps. After\r\nprayer, they took a bold step and to the glory of God,\r\ntheir faith delivered a good answer to their prayer.\r\nPaul the Apostle said, he could do all things in Christ. \"I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. Philippians 4 vs. 13.\r\nHe succeeded through the power of faith. Your faith will deliver a good result in Jesus name. Amen\r\n1. Faithfulness: This simply means being loyal, firm or devoted to a person, cause or idea.\r\n\"Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.\"1Corinthians 4 vs. 2\r\nJoseph was faithful to the end in the house of Potiphar inspite of what he went through there. His master\'s entire property was kept under his control and he did not betray his faithfulness to Potiphar.\r\n\"And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian. And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand. And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand. And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian\'s house for Joseph\'s sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field. And he left all that he had in Joseph\'s hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured.\"Genesis 39 vs. 2- 6\r\nHis master\'s wife tried to seduce him, but he did not Succumb or take advantage of the privilege he was enjoying in the house to betray his faithfulness to his master.\r\n\"And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her. And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business and there was none of the men of the house there within. And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out. And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth, That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice: \"Genesis 39 vs. 10-14\r\nJoseph preferred to go to prison because of his faithfulness. He said how could he do such an unlawful thing and sin against God. No wonder faithfulness took him to a higher grand and made him the second in command in Egypt, a foreign land Show me a faithful man or woman and I will show you the glory he has acquired on earth.\r\nLet us also consider David in the palace of King Saul. He was faithful to the king to the last. Despite what King Saul did to him, he did not falter in his faithfulness to him.\r\n\"The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness: for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD\'s anointed.\"1Samuel\r\n26 vs. 23\r\nThe faithfulness of David made him king over Israel. Success is possible in the Lord, but faithfulness is required. Whatever persecution you might be facing in your place of work or your colleagues are even trying to involve you in an ungodly or unlawful act; don\'t forget that you are a child of God and must not compromise your faithfulness to God and your superiors. Remain faithful. \r\n2. Good character: A dictionary defines character as the aggregate of features and qualities that make a person or thing different from others. Joseph had a good character in the house of Potiphar. David also conducted himself well in the palace of King Saul, so much that even the king testified to it.\r\n\"Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place. 1Samuel 26 vs. 25\r\nImagine a situation where a boss could give a good testimony about his servant. It shows that such a servant portrays a good character. Some say your character, is the best marketer that will market you. Check your character.\r\n3. Humility: Humility is the quality or condition of being humble. Despite the grace of God upon Moses, he humbled himself. \"(Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.)\"Numbers. 12 vs. 3\r\nMindless of what the people he was leading did to him; even to the extent that his own relations stood against him, yet Moses humbled himself before them. It was God that fought for him.\r\n\"Blessed are the meek, For they shall inherit the earth. Matthew 5 vs. 5\r\nThe humble or meek is blessed already by God. It\'s a great Armour of God that exalts man to greatness. It\'s a habit that someone needs to cultivate. Whoever possesses the spirit of humility will surely succeed in his goal in life.\r\n4. Planning: God can only show you what you will become, I mean your purpose on earth, but he will not plan for you. Planning is not the assignment of God but man\'s.\r\nFor which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?\r\nLest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,\r\nSaying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish. \"Luke 14 vs. 28-30\r\nAnyone that wants to have a successful goal must not joke with planning. Whoever fails to plan before doing anything is definitely planning to fail.\r\nPlanning is as important as the other afore- mentioned armour of God to succeed. If you don\'t plan and ultimately fail, you\'ll be mocked. And where mockery sets in, frustration will take charge of your heart. Always plan before doing things.\r\n5. Praise & worship: Our Creator desires praise and worship from us\r\n\"But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light: 1Peter 2 vs.9.\r\nIf truly you want to succeed and achieve your goal in life, one of the armour of God you need to put on is praise and worship. The more you praise or worship God, the more He will show Himself unto you and do a great thing in your life.\r\nIf you cultivate the habit of praise and worship, you will not lack the divine presence of God. Moses praised God while they were still in the wilderness and God did many signs and wonders in their midst.\r\n\"Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders? Exodus 15 vs.11\r\nKing David was a praise addict and God turned his life around.\r\n\"I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.\"2Samunel 22 vs. 4.\r\n	Through praises, God granted David victory over his enemies. It made God to love David extraordinarily. Praise and worship are food you need to give to God every day of your life. Praise and worship stand as a weapon of war. God told King Jehoshaphat to set up singers to sing praises unto God at the border of Tekoa. They did that and God granted them victory over their enemies.\r\n\"And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with a loud voice on high.0 And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper. And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy endureth fo ever. And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.\"2Choronicles 20 vs. 19-22\r\nGod set an ambush against the enemies of King Jehoshaphat through praises.\r\nWhen Prophet Elisha needed to hear from God, he organized people that could sing praises and when they started singing, heaven opened and he started delivering the message of God.\r\n\"But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.\" 2Kings 3 vs. 15\r\nRemember Paul and Silas also sang praises unto the Lord and the gate of the prison got opened and there was an earthquake.\r\n\"And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them. And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one\'s bands were loosed. And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled. \"Acts 16 vs. 25-27\r\nPraise and worship always provoke God to do signs and wonders. If you want God to move in your life in a special way, go into praise and worship, and you will see how God will move. If you desire success in your goal, then give God quality praises and you will see that heaven will open for you. God will grant you the grace to be a praise addict in Jesus name. Amen.', 'POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT\r\nBefore Christ commenced His assignment on earth, He went for power from the above and was greatly endowed with it.\r\n\"And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about. \"Luke 4 vs. 14.\r\nWhen Jesus returned from the wilderness, He was loaded with the power of God and started His assignment. Many miracles happened through Him and many souls were won to the Kingdom of God. The power of the Holy Spirit is very essential to any set goal, in order to achieve success.\r\nLet us also look at the example of the Disciples of Christ, before they started the assignment committed to their hands. They too sought for endowment of God\'s power. They were in the Upper room for ten days praying for the power of God. And after ten days, the power came upon them.\r\n\"And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven. \"Acts 2 vs, 1-5.\r\nConsequently, they did the assignment effectively and enjoyed the divine presence of God. Signs and wonders happened through them, because of the power of God that came upon them.\r\n\"But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:\" Acts 2 vs. 14 Peter was hitherto a coward; but when the power of the Holy Spirit came upon him, he stood up with the eleven Disciples and addressed the multitude that came. In the end, they won over three thousand souls at a time.\r\n\"And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us. And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them. Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength. And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.\" Acts 3 vs. 4-8.\r\nThe power of the Holy Spirit makes an ordinary man to become supernatural. And this means that what an ordinary man cannot do, a man endowed with God\'s power will do it.\r\nPeter and John were going to the temple for prayer and they met a man that could not walk by the gate called beautiful. The power of God in the life of Peter moved him to heal this cripple. Peter held the man and lifted him up and the man began to walk immediately. What a miracle! Before any Christian starts any assignment, the first thing he needs is the power of God to carry out the assignment successfully. Why? Because it is one thing to start an assignment, it is another thing to succeed. \r\n\"Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth in mount Zion. \"Isaiah 8 vs.18\r\nGod is not expecting believers to succeed the way people of the world succeed. The success of the believers must be supernatural and unique. The book of Isaiah says we are for signs and wonders. And that is why you need to thirst for the power of the Holy Spirit. The only means to get this power is to thirst for it.\r\nIn the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.\" John 7 vs. 37-38.\r\nOf course, if any man is naturally thirsty, he\'ll look for water to drink. So also if any believer is spiritually thirsty, he\'ll be fed with the Holy Spirit power. Before you can receive the power of the Holy Spirit, you must thirst for it.\r\nIf you receive the power, it will make you untouchable to Satan and his agents. \"Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my\r\nprophets no harm. \"Psalms 105 vs. 15. Besides, no evil weapon devised against you will prosper.\r\n\"No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.\" Isaiah 54 vs. 17.\r\nThe power will make you a celebrity of your time. Our Lord Jesus said that, we shall perform more miracles even more than He did.\r\n\"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.\" John 14 vs. 12.\r\nNo wonder, the miracles that happened through the first Apostles were marvelous. The shadow of Simon Peter alone healed people along the street, while the apron of Apostle Paul also healed the sick.\r\nâ€˜â€™And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.\" Acts 19 vs.11-12.\r\nA dead woman called Dorcas came to life through the prayer of Simon Peter. The power of God in the life of any believer will announce God in his ministry or work.\" And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.\" Daniel 11vs. 32.  \r\nThe power will make you strong and facilitate unique exploits. It\'s very essential to anyone who wants to succeed in his desired goal in life. The first Apostles succeeded because of God\'s power that came upon them. Friend, you too need the power.', 'OPPOSITION\r\nEvery success attracts opposition. There is no success without a story. \"For a great door and effectual is opened unto me and there are many adversaries.\" 1Corinthians 16 vs. 9.\r\nBefore Joseph started having the dreams of progress, there was no any opposition. But the moment he began to see the picture of success, opposition stood against him. \"And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more. And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:\r\nFor, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.\r\nAnd his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.\r\nAnd he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.\r\nAnd he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?\r\nAnd his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying. Genesis87 vs. 5-11.\r\nAnybody could stand in opposition against you. It was Joseph\'s brethren that stood as opposition to his success; to the extent that they were planning to kill him. If you desire success in one way or the other, you need to be very careful in every area of life. The devil could use anybody to stand against your success. Just imagine the case of Joseph and his brethren; they fought him to the point of killing him. They forgot that if Joseph became great or succeeded in life, it would affect them positively. Later on, they succeeded in selling Joseph to the land of Egypt, if not for God that helped him out.\r\n\"Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt\". Genesis 37 vs.28.\r\nBefore selling him, they cast him inside a pit in order to die there. Afterwards, they brought him out and sold him to the Ishmaelite traders.\r\nSatan does not underestimate anyone. It was just a dream that Joseph told his brothers, but they interpreted it with resentment and concluded within themselves that their younger brother would be greater than them. Though opposition could stand as spiritual exercise that would gear someone to be serious about his goal.\r\nEven David that had a good intention for his nation, had opposition stood against him. David risked his life in order to deliver the people of Israel from the hands of Goliath, the Philistine.\r\n\"And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God? And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him. And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab\'s anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightiest see the battle. And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?1Samuel 17 vs.26-29.\r\nIt was his brother, Eliab that stood against him that he would not be able to fight the Philistine. But David said God had a reason for bringing him into such a case.\r\nAfter God has used David to defeat the enemy of Israel, another opposition rose against him, this time from King Saul.\r\n\"And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick. And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands. And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom? And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.\" 1Samuel 18 vs. 6-9.\r\nGod used David to bring peace to the kingdom of Saul. But instead of the king to appreciate what David did for him and the entire land of Israel, he became an enemy of David. Don\'t forget that there\'s no enemy that wants you to live but to die. King Saul wanted David to die, but for God that delivered him from the hand of the king.\r\nSuccess is not sweet without opposition. If you want get to the top, get ready for opposition because they will surely rise against you, whether you like it or not. The level of your success will determine the level of opposition that will rise against you. There is no achievement or success in life without its own opposition.\r\nWHY OPPOSITION?\r\nOpposition is a must to every success. It is Biblical. Our God even had opposition in heaven when Satan stood against Him. He wanted to overthrow the government of God, consequent upon which there was a great war in heaven.\r\nAnd there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death.\" Revelation 12 vs. 7-11\r\nIn the end, God defeated Satan the opposition leader with the blood of the lamb and with the word of testimony. I pray that you will overcome anyone that opposes yours in Jesus name. Amen. So why do we encounter opposition on the way to success?\r\n1. Number one reason for opposition is to open your understanding to know that every success attracts opposition.\r\n\"For a great door and effectual is opened unto me and there are many adversaries.\" 1Corinthians 16 vs.9\r\nThere\'s no success you would talk about that was achieved on a platter of gold without any opposition. You do not need to invite them, they will surely come. There was a time a sister told me about her experience when she was still in the primary school. She said the day her father proudly showed his relations her excellent academic report card, was the day she lost her memory so much so that she could not read and write very well anymore. Opposition! The moment you are ready to achieve a goal is the same moment opposition will commence their assignment against you.\r\n2. Get ready to fight opposition. If you are sure of achieving success in your goal, you must be ready to fight. God told the people of Israel to fight the opposition that rose against them.\r\n\"Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle. \"Deuteronomy 2 vs. 24.\r\nYou don\'t just wake up one day and pick up success; you have to fight it out. God fought His enemies and it\'s expected of you to fight yours.\r\n3. To build your spiritual strength and open your understanding to the wiles of the devil.\r\n\"I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. \"Philippians 4 vs. 13.\r\nThe more you face the opposition, the more you get strength and discover the strategy the opposition is using against you.\r\n4. To show or prove whether your goal receives the approval of God or not. If you have the backing of God over what you are doing, no devil can get you down. You are sure of victory.\r\n\"So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.\" Isaiah 59 vs. 19.\r\nThe more the enemy stands against you, the more you progress and enjoy the full backing of God.\r\n5. To have story to tell. There\'s no one that succeeds without a story. When Jacob got to the palace of Pharaoh, he told Pharaoh what he went through in life.\r\n\"And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou? And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.\" Genesis 47 vs. 8-9.\r\n6. What you went through before you succeed will be a good and interesting story you must not forget after actualizing your goal. I pray you will have a good story to tell in Jesus name.\r\n7. Opposition is a good way of discovering the greatness of God upon your life. Opposition will surely stand against you, but God\'s power will be there to set you free.\r\n\"Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. Psalms 105 vs. 15 Whoever that attacks you with an evil weapon will\r\nexperience the anger of God.\r\nWhen Pharaoh stood against the people of Israel from going to the Promised Land, God showed His greatness in diverse ways. The Red sea parted into two for the people of God to pass.\r\n\"The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace. And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:\"Exodus 14 vs. 14-15.\r\nNaturally speaking, nothing could divide that mighty sea, but the power of God divided it. If your enemy sees the greatness of God upon you and your ministry, they will run away from you. Enemy will not get you in Jesus name. Amen. \r\nPREPARATION AGAINST OPPOSITION\r\nThere are vital points you need to know to help you withstand opposition.\r\n1. Expect opposition It is scriptural to see and experience opposition. I may even call opposition part of the instruments of achieving success, because it has its own positive side of helping a man that needs to achieve success at all cost. It was the opposition that stood against Joseph that made him to reach his goal. Let us see what Joseph told his brethren when they started begging him not to afflict them after the death of their father in\r\n\"And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants. And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?\r\nBut as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive. \"Genesis 50 vs. 18-20 Supposing Joseph was not persecuted and opposed, he might not have reached his goal in life. Opposition led him to where God will be glorified in his life. Those opposing you will lead you to your breakthrough in Jesus name. Amen.\r\nBuild up spiritual stamina. Much as you expect opposition, you need to build up your spiritual strength to stand against any attack of the enemy.\r\n\"If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.\"Proverbs 24 vs. 10\r\nThere are certain situations that will traumatize you beyond what you can bear. such situation serials maturity. God told Joshua to be courageous and strong in the Lord because of opposition.\r\n\"Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.\"Joshua 1 vs. 7.\r\nEven with what God did through Moses to set the people of Israel free from the hands of the wicked king Pharaoh, the people still waged a serious war against him when they needed water and meat.\r\n\"So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water. And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah. And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?\r\nAnd he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them, \"Exodus 15 vs. 22-25\r\n\"And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat? We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick: But our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes.\" Num. 11 vs. 4-6.\r\nDespite what God did for them, there were still opposing elements in their midst. And do not forget that opposition could be anybody; parent, wife or husband etc. but the most important thing is to get yourself prepared against it.\r\n3. Grace of discernment It\'s good to know and understand everyone around you through the power of God, as the power to discern this way helps a lot. A situation where you don\'t have this power, you might mistakenly enter the trap of the opposition. The Bible says we should test all spirits and know which is of God and the devil. Discernment is a gift of the spirit and it helps in no small measure to reveal the hide-out of opposition. \r\nThe person stabbing you in the back or opposing your success might be someone very close to you. It takes the special grace of God to discover such a person.\r\nIt was the spirit of God in Jesus that made Him to discover the plot of Judas Iscariot. Jesus discovered Judas was the thorn among the good seeds. But the power of God uncovered his secret plan against Jesus. You\'ll discover and overcome everyone that opposes you in Jesus Name. Amen.\r\n4. Employ the power of prayer. The first thing for you to do when you are facing any challenge is to take the case to God in prayer.\r\n\"And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me. \"Psalms 50 vs. 15.\r\nPrayer is the weapon that can destroy the plan of the opposition against you. They can go any length to destroy a person. It was the power of prayer that delivered Simon Peter from the hands of King Herod in the prison.\r\n\"Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him. And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.\r\nAnd, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.\r\nAnd the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me. And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.\" Acts 12 vs. 5-9.\r\nThe church began to pray for peter to be free from the prison of King Herod. Following this, God sent His angel to set Peter free from the prison. It is prayer that can do such a thing. Always use the power of prayer when opposition rises against you. It was prayer that Jesus used to defeat Satan in the wilderness.\r\n\"And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered. And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread. And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.\" Luke 4 vs. 1-4.\r\nBut make sure you get yourself rooted in the Word of God before you start to pray. It\'s the Word that can defeat Satan not the amount of noise you make during prayer. Study the Word of God very well so as to stand against Satan any day, anytime he attacks you. Prayer is very powerful.\r\n5. Exercise the power of forgiveness. One thing you must understand is that people will always offend you and you must cultivate the habit of forgiveness as Christ said to Simon Peter, to forgive as many times as possible those that might offend him.\r\n\"Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?\" Matthews 18 vs. 21.\r\nGod expects you to forgive whoever that offends you, so that your heavenly father will forgive you all your own sins as well.\r\n\"For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.\" Matthew 6 vs.14- 15.\r\nAnyone that finds it difficult to forgive and forget will never be free from the spirit of bitterness. And bitterness will give birth to high blood pressure which might lead to death.\r\n\"Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled; \"Hebrews 12 vs. 15.\r\nThe scriptures tell us we should not allow bitterness to dwell in our heart. Whoever that gives no room for forgiveness will never see God, let alone receive anything from Him. Jesus said, you should forgive and forget knew that the end of forgiveness is bad. Lack of forgiveness is an arrow that Satan uses to distract the heart of anyone from his goal. Learn to forgive so as to succeed in your goal in life. Forgiveness frees the heart from the bondage of the devil and enhances a new vision and focus for anyone that forgives.\r\nDon\'t forget that you will always be offended and it\'s expected of you to forgive and forget.', 'CONCLUSION\r\nSuccess is a right of every human being, but not everyone succeeds due to what it takes to succeed. Someone said, success is an adventure. It is very easy to talk about success, but to achieve it is a big task.\r\nMany set goals they want to achieve, but not all goals are achievable due to what it takes. Many lack finance, right information, planning and power of God that will help them to succeed. Apostle Paul said, he could do all things through Christ that strengthened him.\r\n\"I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. \"Philippians 4 vs. 13.\r\nHe trusted God so much for everything; no wonder he succeeded. It is one thing to set a goal, it is another thing to receive divine grace to succeed. Don\'t forget it is not by power or might.\r\n\"Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts. \"Zachariah 4 vs.6\r\nNo matter how beautiful your goal may look, you need the support of God before you can succeed. Apostle Paul sought after the power of God to succeed in his race in life.\r\n\"That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings. being made conformable unto his death; Phillippians 3vs.10.\r\nThe power helped him to achieve his goal without stress or manipulations of the devil. For a great door and effectual is opened unto me\r\nand there are many adversaries.\" 1Corinthians 16 vs 9.\r\nGod already had a plan for you before you arrived here on earth; but Satan as well has his own plan to tack the plan and purpose of God for your life. What you need therefore is divine support; I mean the power of God Almighty. No one receives the power of God that does not achieve his goal.\r\n\"Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.\" Hebrews 12 vs. 2.\r\nMake sure you focus your full attention on God that has all the power both in heaven and on earth.\r\n\"But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, with men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.\" Matthew 19 vs. 26\r\nMoreover, God is the only one that can make things possible for you either physically or spiritually. He i the Alpha and Omega of everything; the beginning and the end. Before you take any step to achieve a goal, God already knows both the beginning and the end of it.\r\nGod is indispensable to everything in life. You cannot do anything successfully without the support of God. You need God in every area of your life. If you have not given your life to Jesus, this is an opportunity for you to know and accept Him as your Lord and Saviour.\r\n\"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Romans 3 vs. 23\r\nSince the time Adam and Eve sinned against God, sin entered the lives of mankind, and every man born of a woman is a sinner. However, God made a perfect way for mankind to become free from the bondage of sin through Jesus Christ.\r\nFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" John 3 vs. 16.\r\nGod demonstrated this by sending His only begotten\" son to die for our sins.\r\nâ€˜â€™But God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for \"Romans 5 vs. 8\r\nChrist died for you and me to regain back what Satan and sin had taken away from our lives as well as to inherit the kingdom of God.\r\n\"But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: John 1 vs. 12\r\nThe Bible says if you give your life to Jesus, you will have the power of God which will make you a son or daughter of God. \r\nAccept Jesus with your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord.\r\n\"But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. \"Romans 10 vs. 8-9\r\nYou might even be saying your sin is too terrible that God cannot forgive you. On the contrary, there\'s no sin that is too big or small that God cannot forgive. Just confess them and pray for forgiveness and the mercy of God. I can assure you that, you\'ll be forgiven by God and made a new person.\r\n\"Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.\"2 Corinthians 5 vs. 17\r\nImmediately you confess your sin and pray for God\'s mercy, the blood that Jesus shed on the cross of Calvary will wash away all your sins and make you a son or daughter of God.\r\nAnd almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.\" Hebrews 9 vs. 22\r\nThe blood of Jesus is powerful; as it washes away sins. You need Jesus Christ in your life.\r\nAs you are giving your life to Jesus, He will accept you and write your name in the book of life. The blessings of God will be your portion and you will succeed in your goal in Jesus name. Amen.', '', '', 'ziggyadex@gmail.com', '2023-06-02', '');

Challenges 6. New Glory', 'INTRODUCTION\r\nOne of the major problems that stand against the progress of man in life is change. The nature of man is so complacent that he is always pleased with what he has achieved and believes it is enough to sustain him against any situation in life. This is a deception of the devil.\r\nThere are two types of change. One is positive and the other is negative. The negative change brings about setback while the positive commands progress in life. If truly you want to enjoy the fullness of God\'s glory in your life, you need to give room for a positive change.\r\n\"But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shinneth more and more unto the perfect day.\"Proverbs 4 vs. 18\r\nThe journey of life is from one level of glory to another. You cannot remain in a particular glory and believe you have acquired the whole world. It is impossible.\r\n\"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.\" 1 Corinthians 15 vs. 41\r\nThe glory the stars exude is far different from the glory of the moon, while the glory of the sun is higher than the glory of the moon. Despite the miracles that happened through Apostle Paul, he was still striving to attain another level of glory in life.\r\n\"That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death; \"Philippians 3 vs.10\r\nChange may not be pleasant but you earnestly need it for a better tomorrow. The sons of the prophets realized that where they dwelled was not conducive for their vision to soar like an eagle; hence they had to move forward and get a better place.\r\n\"And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us. Let us go, we pray thee, unio Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye. \"2 Kings 6 vs. 1-2\r\nJust because you suffered before you could rent one bedroom apartment, you decided to remain there and don\'t dream to go for a bigger and better place. Your decision is borne out of a mentality to limit yourself unnecessarily due to frustration. Before you know what is happening, that room will become cramped and will no more contain your wife and children and the consequent disgrace will make you popular in a negative form.\r\nNo matter how enjoyable your present level may be, it cannot sustain your tomorrow. Strive hard to attain a better and viable level for a greater tomorrow.\r\nI pray that as you read this book, God in heaven will open your understanding in the precious name of Jesus Christ.\r\nPositive change is very vital for a glorious future and wonderful testimony in life.\r\nBe ready to pay the price. God will grant you abundant grace in Jesus name. Amen \r\n\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\r\nMy greatest appreciation goes to God Almighty, the creator of heaven and earth for making this book a reality for both the spiritual and physical blessings of mankind.\r\nMy wonderful helper Mrs. Temitope Folashade Adedeji I appreciate your effort towards the success of this book.\r\nI also use this moment to acknowledge the support of Mr. Aderemi Lawal, Mr. Oladipupo, Mrs. Akoja and Mr. Mafu Shaba for making this dream a success.\r\nFinally, I appreciate my great Evangelists, Secretary as well as men and women whose names are too many to mention.\r\nI say thank you and God Almighty will bless you in Jesus name.

So they went to the man of God, Prophet Elisha to complain about this. It implies that before you can effect any positive change, you must have a clear understanding of your present situation. If you study the present situation critically, and you look into the future, you will discover that what you are now is nothing compared to what God has for you. The present situation may be wonderful, but God has something more wonderful for you in the future. The Bible says that \"the path of the just is like a shining light that shines more and more unto the perfect day\" Proverbs 4:18\r\nA man worked in a friend\'s company for many years as an accounts clerk with just the Ordinary Level Certificate. He was satisfied with his academic level and failed to acquire a higher qualification. The son of the owner of the company later graduated from the university with a degree in Accounting. This university graduate took over the accounts department of the company, while the former accountant, who refused to grow academically, was relieved of his duty. He lacked foresight to see into the future to know that his O\' level certificate would not be suitable enough in a growing company of that standard. Look beyond the present situation and desire a positive change to keep you relevant in life.\r\n\"Arise ye and depart, for this is not your rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction. Micah 2:10\r\nMany people in this generation are destroying their future unknowingly as they don\'t want to change their present situations. They think their present attainment or status is enough to face tomorrow\'s challenges.\r\nThe sons of the prophets realized this and probably thought that their master, Prophet Elisha might die at anytime, and if they did not change their \'present situation\' on time, they might be left in a mess. If you do not change your present situation, it will change you.\r\nSamuel failed to change his delinquent children. Behold, the situation dramatically changed and the Israelites demanded for a King as his children lacked the qualities of leadership.\r\n\"And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel... And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment. Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah, And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a King to judge us like all the nations: 1 Samuel 8 vs. 3-5\r\nSamuel would not have thought that the Israelites could revolt against his choice of his children as judges over them. He didn\'t study the \'present situation\' well enough to know that his children were not fit to be future judges in Israel.\r\nNo matter how pleasant the present situation may seem to be, plan ahead for the future. David had an insight into the future. He knew that the potentials of God in him were more than staying in the wilderness with his father\'s flock. When the opportunity for a positive change came, he seized it and his \'present situation\' changed for the better.\r\n\"And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying: what shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God.? And the people answered him after this manner, saying, so shall it be done to the man that killeth him. And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab\'s anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause? 1 Samuel 17 vs. 26-29\r\nJust as in the case of David, the steps you take towards a positive change may be mis-interpreted as pride. \'I know thy pride and the naughtiness of thine heart...\'\r\nHowever, do not allow the situation to overwhelm your thoughts on the positive step to take. More so, in the course of your pursuit of a positive change, beware of wrong advice or assistance from people.\r\nNote that, the weapons and coats of armour that King Saul gave to David were too heavy and clumsy for the young man. They made his movement difficult. So, beware of wrong support or assistance that will destroy your dreams and hinder the glory of God in your life.\r\nQUIET TIME\r\nQuiet time is a time to be alone with God. It is a time to ponder on your present situation, ask yourself questions and think of the way forward.\r\n1 Kings 19:12-15, And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice. And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, what doest thou here, Elijah?\r\nAnd he said I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain thine prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away. And the Lord said to him, Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when you come, anoint Hazael to be King over Syria:\"\r\nElijah could not understand what was happening to him until he heard from the Lord in a \"still small voice\". You cannot get the right answers or solution to the mysteries of life in a noisy environment. Quiet time animates and activates the five senses and enables you to see and understand clearly the true pictures of life.', 'â€˜â€™You thought you know many things\r\nbut you don\'t Understand many thingsâ€™â€™\r\n\r\n\r\nA CLEAR UNDERSTANDING\r\nIf you pay attention to your present situation, your inner eyes will open and you will have a clear understanding of your situation. When the sons of the prophets paid attention to their situation, they became enlightened. Many people live on earth but have no clear understanding of their existence. Don\'t forget there is just one life to live on earth. It is one thing to see what is happening in life and it is another to understand it. Many are living a pitiable life because they lack understanding.\r\nUnderstanding entails the truth and facts about something. The truth reveals details of an issue while the fact gives the picture. Today, the truth is missing in our lives. The Bible says in John 8 vs. 32 \"And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.\r\nPeople around you may rise against you, if only they have the facts about you and not the truth. You are the only one that has the truth about yourself.\r\nA man came to Nigeria from abroad armed with the certainty and truth about his vision, but his friends thought he was stupid. Unbelievably, he is a millionaire today.\r\nWhen the sons of the prophets saw that the vision of God for them was greater than where they were, they took steps to change it.\r\nIn Acts 8:26-32\" And the angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, arise, and go toward the south to the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is desert. And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship, was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Isaiah the Prophet. Then the spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot. And Philip ran there to him, and heard him read the prophet Isaiah, and said, understand you what you read? And he said, \"how can I, except some man should guide me\"? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him. The place of the scripture which he read was this; He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened He not His mouth\".\r\nMany people know many things but they do not understand them. The Ethiopian eunuch has been reading the book of Isaiah, but had no understanding of it. Do you understand your own situation? If not, go for a clear understanding.\r\nIn Daniel 9:2-3 \"In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem. And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting and sackcloth, and ashes:\"\r\nIt was the understanding that Daniel had that saved the wise men of Israel from perishing in Babylon. Lack of understanding will ultimately lead to destruction.\r\nHOW TO ACQUIRE UNDERSTANDING\r\nUnderstanding helps to know the things of the past, the present and the future. So how can you acquire understanding?\r\n1. Through learning: You acquire understanding through learning by studying relevant books, listening to CD/Tapes, attending seminars etc.\r\n\"Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. II Timothy 2 vs. 15\r\n2. By moving with those who have gone ahead of you. If you move with those who have gone ahead of you either academically, socially, spiritually or otherwise, you will enlightened and acquire understanding.\r\n\"And if any man think that he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know\" 1 Corinthians 8:2\r\n3. You acquire understanding from God through prayer.\r\n\"But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding\" Job 32:8', 'â€˜â€™Right information, planning and\r\ndivine leading will enhance positive changeâ€™â€™\r\n\r\n \r\nCHANGE\r\n\"Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye. And one said, be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go. 2 Kings 6 vs. 2-3\r\nPeople do not see any need for a change because they are satisfied with their present situation. Nevertheless, for a change to take place I mean a positive change, there must be a challenge to tackle first. And if this challenge is tackled rightly, it will surely lead to a positive change.\r\nWHAT IS CHANGE?\r\nChange means to become different, moving from one level to another level in life. Unfortunately, this is a major problem to many in life. Once people are adapted to a particular system, they find it difficult to change. Also in\r\nActs 18:24-26, \"And certain Jew named Apollos born at Alexandria an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus. This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spoke and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John. And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him to them, and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly\"\r\nApollos knew only the gospel of baptism of John. Aquila and Pricilla noticed that he needed a change, and therefore explained in full details to him the Gospel of the Lord Jesus.\r\nAs far as many of us are concerned, change is a problem; but to the sons of the prophets, change was inevitable. They had to go to Elisha to make a demand for a change despite what they were enjoying in their \'present\".\r\nThere are two types of change: One is negative and the other is positive.\r\nNEGATIVE CHANGE\r\nWhat brings about a negative change? It is a frustrated situation that brings about a negative change. If you fail to change a situation, that situation will change you. A man of God who fails to develop himself, but always soliciting for an opportunity to preach in other ministers\' churches is an example of one in a frustrated situation. Similarly, a dress designer that refuses to collect clothes for sewing, with an excuse of no electricity to iron clothes sewn is only cooking up a flimsy excuse to defend her frustration.\r\nThere was a man that was highly reputable for repair of typewriting machines in those days. But with the invention of computers, typewriters were phased out and the man was advised to learn how to repair computers. He refused and claimed that what he was getting from repair of typewriters was enough. Now that the use of computer has overridden the use of typewriter globally, the man has ended up an Okada rider (a commercial motor- bike rider in the Nigerian parlance). This is negative change. a\r\n2 Timothy 2 vs.15 says \"Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth\".\r\nPOSITIVE CHANGE\r\n\"Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the King, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish. Esther 4 vs. 16\r\nA positive change is a change from one level of life to a better level. It is a movement from a pathetic level to a celebrated level. It is a change that many desire, but not many are ready to pay the price. Can you take a decisive step and deny yourself of worldly pleasures to make a positive change? Queen Esther paid the price on behalf of the Jews. She took a bold risk, and a deadly situation changed to life. Are you pleased with your present situation? Can it sustain your tomorrow? If not, be ready for a positive change. The entire Jews testified. If you can take the risk, your testimony is sure.\r\n\"I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me\". Philippians 4 vs. 13 Paul the Apostle prayed for God\'s help and strength and God granted him. You also can pray for God\'s help for a positive change.', 'Right information,\r\nplanning and divine leading\r\nwill enhance positive change\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEPS TO A POSITIVE CHANGE\r\n1. A Clear Vision\r\nA clear vision enhances a positive change. Don\'t take a step without a sure and strong vision and conviction. Be sure to make enquires, know the advantages and disadvantages involved before embarking on a project.\r\nLuke 14:28 states \"For which of you intending to build a tower, sits not down first and counts the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?. While Habakkuk 2:2 And the Lord answered me, and said, Write the vision and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that read it. \r\nI pray as you take the step for a change, God will back you up in Jesus name. (Amen)\r\n2. Total Conviction\r\nThis is another essential step to achieving a positive change. Irrespective of the discouraging words from people around you; you need to view that step in the mirror of God and be totally convinced before taking a step.\r\n\"Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father\'s house, unto a land that I will shew thee: And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. Genesis 12 vs. 1-3\r\n3. Adequate Knowledge\r\n\"This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate therein day and night, that thou mayestobserve to do according to all that is written therein: for then you shall make your way prosperous and then you shall have good success\". Joshua 1:8.\r\nYou must have adequate knowledge of what you want to venture into because information brings transformation. Information enables you to have an edge over others.\r\n4. A Clear Understanding\r\nThis is getting the details of what you want to do. Know the rudiments and the nitty-gritty. Make sure you have a clear understanding of it.\r\nMatthew 15 vs. 16-17 \"And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding? Do not ye yet understand that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out the draught?\r\nJesus expected His disciples to have a full understanding of what they were doing. Understanding is the bedrock to a positive change.\r\n5. Wisdom of God\r\n\"If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct. 1 Samuel 18:14, And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him.\" Ecclesiastes 10:10.\r\nIt is the wisdom of God that guarantees good motives. Despite all King Saul did to David, he still dealt with the king wisely. You need to apply wisdom because it is profitable.\r\n6. Determination\r\nBe a strong-willed person; be determined to make a change just as Daniel did by not eating the King\'s meat.\r\nDaniel 1:8 \"But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the King\'s meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.\"\r\nIf you are not determined you can\'t get to your fulfillment. Anyone that needs a positive change must be determined to make the change occur by all means. It was the determination of Daniel that made him great in a strange land. You need to be determined before fulfillment will knock at your door.\r\n7. Focus\r\nLet your decision be firm; do not deviate from the decision you have taken, no matter how strong the distractions around you may be. Be focused! Concentrate on what you are doing. Do not entertain rumours. Give no room for distractions. At the end of your fulfillment, those who tried to make you lose focus will celebrate you. If you are focused and determined, your mind will not be divided.\r\nProverbs 4: 23 \"Keep your heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.\"\r\nA little distraction can end a glorious journey of life. Give no room for distraction.\r\n8. Diligence Be committed to the step or decision you have taken. Work hard towards the achievement of your goal. Give no room to slothfulness. This will make you stand out from others, even when you are all pursuing the same cause. Fulfillment never leaves the door of a diligent person. Many know the right thing to do but they are too lazy to do it. Laziness has turned many to beggars, thereby killing their vision and strangulating their glory. Some ministers of God are not exempted from this crushing laziness. Apart from the normal Sunday service and weekly activities they handle, they do not have any other activity doing that can promote their ministries.\r\nJohn 5:17 says \"But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto until now, and I work.\"\r\n9. Fervent Prayer\r\nPrayer is a very good antidote to failure. Without God you can\'t achieve anything in life. Every effort made will be useless because there are forces contending with you, that prefer you rather have a negative change to a positive change. The Bible says in James 5:16 \"Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that you may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much\".\r\nEnemies do not want you to succeed, hence the Lord told the Israelites to contend with the inhabitants of the land.\r\nDeuteronomy 2 vs. 24 \"Rise you up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, King of Heshbon, and his land: begin to posses it, and contend with him in battle\".\r\nNever forget the place of prayer, because the place of prayer is the zone of winners.\r\nA woman once told one of her customers to wait for her to pray before attending to her because she saw a sign that portrayed the devilish intention of the customer. The book of Jeremiah 17:9 says \"The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it? Prayer is the master key to your successful journey in life. Pay attention to prayer.\r\n10. Associating with the right-minded leader \"He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed\". Proverbs 13 vs. 20.\r\nAssociate with a leader who has a good mind and interest in your advancement. Eli was good to Samuel and that was the reason he gave the boy the right counsel when Samuel told him of his divine call. Some leaders are bad. Once they know about your good vision, they would destroy it\r\nThere was a man of God who used to curse the pastors under him whenever they told him they received a divine call to move forward. Are you a good or bad leader? Don\'t forget that what goes around comes around. One thing that is sure about this life is that, you will reap the fruit of your leadership.\r\nWhosoever you choose as your leader or mentor determines what you will become. If you are under the influence of a positive minded leader, it is then you can be an achiever. A positive mind breeds a positive change. John 16 vs.33 declares \"These things I have spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.\r\nJohn 17 vs. 14-15 \"I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from evil.\"\r\nOur Lord Jesus was a good leader to His disciples. He advised, taught, encouraged and prayed for them. A good leader must possess the good spirit of Christ. Philippians 2 vs. 5 \"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus\". A good leader must produce tomorrow\'s leaders. Jesus produced twelve leaders while the twelve disciples produced one hundred and twenty (120) others. The ripple effect of that is reflected in the innumerable believers of Christ in the world today.', 'No Canaan without its\r\nown challenges\r\n\r\n\r\nCHALLENGES\r\nGod can only tell you what you will become but He will not tell you the challenges inherent in the course of getting there. It is good to have a good dream as they say, \'Canaan is real\', but there is a battle to be fought and won. It was God that told the Israelites to leave Egypt for Canaan, but He never told them the difficulties on the way to Canaan. Success comes after subduing every obstacle on the way.\r\nEvery step of a positive change attracts Satan\'s attention and interest. \"For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries\". 1Corinthians 16: 9. There can be no promotion without examination. Winners never quit but losers. Don\'t quit because of challenges of the race. Your breakthrough is very near. \'Keep on keeping on\'.\r\nWHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES?\r\nChallenges are the enemy of your destiny on the way to fulfillment. They could be in form of:\r\n1. Fear\r\nThe Fear of the unknown usually confines many people to their \'present\', sometimes to a precarious situation. Fear does not produce success, but rather destruction. Anyone who allows fear will never share a testimony. Say No to fear! 2 Timothy 1 vs. 7 \"For God hath not given us the spirit of fear: but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. Fear is not made for a believer. Liberty and confidence are believers\' attributes. Receive your liberty and confidence in Jesus name. (Amen)\r\n2. Complacency\r\nDo not be comfortable with your present condition. You need to desire a change before it can occur. Take a step to leave that position you are now, and move forward to a greater height. If you are satisfy with the present situation, you can\'t achieve a positive change. The state of satisfaction you are today may not help to solve tomorrow\'s challenges. Any man of God that depends on yesterday\'s anointing will not move forward in life.\r\n\"Arise ye and depart, for this is not your rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.\" Micah 2 vs.10 Many have been destroyed because of their refusal to change their present situation.\r\n3. Envy\r\nFear of being envied makes some people to be afraid of moving forward. No matter the level you are, people will always envy you and say a lot of things about you; but don\'t let that bother or hinder you from moving forward. People are afraid of being an object of envy. For instance, they are afraid of wearing new or beautiful clothes. Don\'t let what people say move you. Allow what God says about you, move and motivate you.\r\nRomans 8 vs.35 says \"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?\r\n4. Family Problem\r\nMany would have been great in life, but family problem debarred them. I pray for anyone facing any family problem, God will arise and fight for you. The sons of the prophets screamed that the axe was borrowed when it fell into the water. Whenever you are facing any problem on the road to success, it does not mean that God is wicked. He only wants to bring out something great beyond your knowledge. When the Israelites murmured against Moses in the wilderness for water, God provided water for them. Whatever you are facing on the road to a positive change, please do not go back! Genesis 9 vs. 22-25 \"And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went back-ward, and covered the nakedness of their father and faces were backward, and they saw not their father\'s nakedness. And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren\". 1Corinthians 16 vs. 9 \"For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries. If you are not a believer you cannot be free from family problem. Your sonship to God through Jesus Christ guarantees your freedom from family problem.\r\nWHY DOES GOD ALLOW CHALLENGES?\r\n1) God allows challenges in order to test your heart.\r\n2) God allows challenges in order to prove\r\nHimself that He is God. When the Israelites drank the water of Marah in the wilderness and it was bitter, the Lord asked Moses to cut a tree and cast it into the water and it became sweet and the people drank. The bitterness thereof was turned into sweetness. I pray that every bitterness in your life will be turned to sweetness in Jesus name (Amen). Exodus 15 vs. 22-25 \"So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness of, and found no water. And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah. And the people murmured against Moses saying, what shall we drink? And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance and there he proved them,\"\r\n3) God allows challenges in order to build up your faith and make you to have complete trust in Him. Hebrews 12 vs. 2 \"Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.\"\r\nHOW TO OVERCOME CHALLENGES\r\n1) Carry God along in whatever you do. The sons of the prophets asked Prophet Elisha to go with them. Moses asked God to follow them when the Israelites left Egypt for Canaan, the Promised Land. The presence of God is very vital in the journey of life. Truly, you are a professional, but if you do not carry God along, your efforts will be in vain. If Elisha had not followed the sons of the Prophet, they would have failed\r\n2) Present your case before God\r\nThe sons of the Prophet presented their case before Elisha who carried the presence of God and he gave them a solution. Whatever you are passing through, present it before God. Laban wanted to kill Jacob but God visited him before dawn. This is because Jacob had presented his case with Laban before God. Do not weep over your problem; but rather, present it before God. Tell God to arise and scatter your enemies. Psalm 68: 1, Let God arise let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.\r\n3) Do not allow the challenge to dominate your life\r\nIf you do not allow the challenge to dominate your life, it will come and go. Whatever you are passing through now is just for a short while. Do not point an accusing finger at God. The English man says, \'It is not over until it is over. Mere dressing of some people speaks volumes of challenges and frustration they are passing through. A man of God said \"You can easily know a frustrated man by his dressing and movement\". If you allow challenges to dominate you, all sorts of suggestions and advice will come your way.\r\n4) Give room for innovations and ideas\r\nWhen you are being confronted by challenges, do not be idle. Do something. Always ask yourself, \'what should be the next step!?\r\n5) Challenges Are Visitors\r\nYou must always see your challenges as a visitor that would come and must surely go. Challenges make a good leader out of you. God can use ridiculous ways to remove challenges in your life. An axe head which was iron fell inside the water and an ordinary stick was used to get it afloat.', 'Glory is very sweet\r\nbut very hard to achieve\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW GLORY\r\nAnyone that desires a positive change must learn to endure. It is endurance that gives birth to new glory. Glory is very easy to express in words, but its manifestation is not a day\'s job. In Genesis 26 vs. 22 \"And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, for now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.\" It does not mean that God was not with him while digging the previous wells. God was with him. God is always with you.\r\nEveryone is born with a vision but, not all will get to its fulfillment. If you do not follow the rules and regulations of the vision, you will miss the glory. Many know how to gather resources, but do not know how to preserve them. If you follow the rules, you are sure of fulfillment. The more you press forward, the more you experience new glor Glory is in stages. Proverbs 4:18 Says, \"But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more unto the perfect day.\" If ve succeed in one step of life, do not stop ther continue to move ahead till the shining light gets into perfection. Every blessed day interprets its own vision. Do not use yesterday\'s blessing to interprete tomorrow\'s vision; Dare to improve! Anything termed \'new\' will surely bring new name, new life, new fame, new product and new place. The challenges of positive change can never be compared to the glory thereafter. Romans 8:18 says, \"For reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.\" 1 prophesy, the glory that will manifest in your life shall swallow all your challenges in Jesus name. (Amen)\r\n1 Corinthians 15: 41-42 \"There is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory. So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:\" Note that the glory of the sun supercedes every other glory because no one can look directly at the sun. Also not everyone that is on the path of the journey of glory gets to fulfillment. Some get tired while some die on the way.\r\nIn Numbers 14:1-12 \"And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night. And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! Or would God we had died in this wilderness! And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? Were it not better for us to return into Egypt? And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt. Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel. And Joshua the son of Nun, Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes: And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land. If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us, a land which floweth with milk and honey. Only rebel not ye against the Lord, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not. But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the Lord appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel. And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? And how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed among them. I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.\" So many started the journey to the Promised Land but only Joshua and Caleb got there. You will get to your Promised Land in Jesus name. (Amen).\r\nIn 2 Timothy 4:10 \"For Demas hath forsaken me having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.\r\nTHE KEYS THAT ENCHANCE NEW GLORY\r\n1. Have the ear of God\r\nIf you do not have the ear of God, it will be difficult for you to know the right thing to do at the right time. Elijah had the ear of God. In 1 Kings 19:12-15 \"And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice. And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in the mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold there came a voice unto him, and said what doest thou here, Elijah? And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away. And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Heazael to be King over Syria: If you desire to achieve a better tomorrow you must not listen to what people are saying but rather let what God says lead you to your glory.\r\n2. Possess the eyes of God\r\nDo not see the way other people see. In Jeremiah 1:11-12, \"Moreover, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree. Then said, the LORD unto me, thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it. If Jeremiah had failed to see what God wanted him to be, we would not have heard anything about him. God has wonderful glory for many people, but they cannot see it. Your ability to see it will commit God to action and fulfillment.\r\n3. Have the mind of God\r\nIf you do not have the mind of God you can never have new glory. Philippians 2:5 says, \"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: The mind of God is creative and achieves goals. You need to possess the mind in order to be creative and achieve your own goals in life. \r\n1. Understanding the language of the present situation\r\nIt is your present situation that determines whether to change what you are doing or not. The time I was having just a secondary school certificate, I could not handle the administrative aspect of my ministry effectively, until I moved forward to learn more. 1 Corinthians 8 vs. 2. \"And if any man think that he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know\". Change your situation before your situation will change you. What you know now is not enough, go for more knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Use your time wisely\r\nThere is time for everything on earth. There is a course titled: \"Time Management\". Learn to abide by it. Do not use the time for work to play and vice versa. Ecclesiastes 3 vs.1 \"To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: John 2 vs. 4 \"Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? Mine hour is not yet come\".\r\n3. Financial Obedience\r\nWhat is financial obedience? Looking at it from the perspective of a child of God, it means paying your tithes and offerings accordingly. Do not play with your tithe. Malachi 3 vs.10 \"Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not room enough to receive it\". If you do not pay your tithes, things will be tight for you. An offering such as the \'kingdom offering\' in our ministry should be paid promptly. It is those who have the kingdom expansion spirit that God will bless. We are in the era of God\'s blessings. Always attend to the needy and the less privileged. And don\'t ever have the mindset that God created some people specially and better than you. What God has packaged in you is enough to effect a positive change and take you to a greater level in life.', '', '', '', '', 'ziggyadex@gmail.com', '2023-06-02', '');

But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation? Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this. And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. \"Genesis 20:3-6\r\n\r\nWhen Abimelech wanted to take the wife of Abraham, God talked to him (Abimelech) in the\r\n\r\ndream to return her back to Abraham.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, when God was trying to reveal Himself unto Jacob in the wilderness, where he spent the night hours; God revealed Himself unto him in the dream.\r\n\r\n\"And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it. \"Genesis 28: 12\r\n\r\nThe gift of dream is very great and powerful. Dream can manifest in the life of man in three ways. It may come from God, Satan and man: As you read this book, you will discover everything.\r\n\r\nDream has no age limit; both the old and young can dream. What a unique gift that makes itself available to every living human being. I was surprised when one of my children told me one day that he had a dream. Imagine God sending a message through a small child regardless of his age. God is great, powerful, marvelous and awesome.\r\n\r\nI pray as you read this book; God will do a great thing in your life in Jesus\' mighty name. Whatever the devil might have destroyed in your life through the dream; God will renew it in Jesus\' name.', '', 'The gift of Dream\r\n\r\nAmong the spiritual gifts that God gives to man, the gift of dream stands out, for the fact that almost every human being dream.\r\n\r\nBefore many people discover their spiritual gift(s), the gift of dream is the first to manifest in them.\r\n\r\nThere are two types of dream that man usually experience. The first one is the imaginary wish or aspiration for something you intend to achieve and is being nursed in your heart. You can call that a dream too. You don\'t need to sleep before you have such a dream.\r\n\r\nNehemiah had a dream to build the wall of Jerusalem that fell down.\r\n\r\n\"And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the Twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him and I took up the wine, and gave it unio the king. Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence. I herefore the king said unto me. Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid, And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers\' sepulchres lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire? Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven. And I said unto the king. If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the gift of dress\r\n\r\nthe city of my fathers\' sepulchres, that I may build it.\" Nehemiah 2:1-5\r\n\r\nIt was not a dream from sleep, but a strong desire to do what he wished in his mind.\r\n\r\nMartin Luther King Junior was fond of saying: \"I have a dream...\" He was not actually telling the world at that time that he had a dream from sleep: rather, he was talking of his great wish or desire that he hoped to achieve in future then. It was a vision which later came true. Anyone that has a wish to achieve something is nursing a dream.\r\n\r\nThe second dream is only experienced when one is asleep and it\'s a gift from God to communicate with man. And that is the one I\'ll be talking about in this book.\r\n\r\n\"But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, the gift of dream\r\n\r\nand said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man\'s wife. But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation? Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this. And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.\" Genesis 20:3-6\r\n\r\nAbimelech was sleeping when God came to him in the dream, in which God revealed to him what He wanted him to know.\r\n\r\nThe solution that God gave to Jacob in the house of Laban was in the dream.\r\n\r\n\"And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled. And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I\" Genesis 31:10-11\r\n\r\nWhen Jacob left Laban and for that reason he wanted to fight Jacob, God talked to him in the dream not to do so.\r\n\r\n\"And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad\" Genesis 31:24\r\n\r\nEven before the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ, God talked to Joseph in the dream.\r\n\r\n\"But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. \"Matthew 1:20\r\n\r\nWhen Herod wanted to kill Jesus, God also spoke to Joseph in the dream and told him not to return to the king.\r\n\r\n\"And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.\" Matthew 2:12-13\r\n\r\nThe Angel of God told them to take the child to Egypt for safety reasons. Some ministers of the Gospel received their call through the dream. I mean God called them to the gospel assignment through the dream. God has told me many things in the dream, which I would have to wake up from sleep to write down. And anything God tells me through this medium must surely come to pass. What a great God! Dream is indeed a mysterious gift.\r\n\r\nIt is not only God that talks to man in the dream. There are two other agents that operate or communicate with man through this channel. The first one is Satan and the other one is man.\r\n\r\nWe shall consider them in details in the next chapter and see what their assignments towards mankind are.\r\n\r\nI pray that whatever medium that God is using to communicate with you will not block in the mighty name of Jesus.', 'Manifestation of Dream\r\n\r\nAs I said earlier on, dream is a spiritual gift that manifests when man sleep and almost every one experiences it. Dream can manifest in three ways. It could serve as a means of spiritual communication from God to man; Satan or the kingdom of darkness and of course from man. We shall be considering these one after the other.\r\n\r\nDREAM FROM GOD\r\n\r\nOur Creator endows us with the gift of dream in order to create a spiritual channel to communicate with us on vital issues of life; like revealing a secret that ordinarily may not be known to man.\r\n\r\n\"Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.\" Jeremiah 33:3\r\n\r\nNothing is hidden before God. He is everything and knows all things. But humans are limited in nature. If anything is not clear to us, we have the right to ask the Omniscient God about it; and He can reveal it to us in the dream.\r\n\r\nIt was God that revealed the secret of a strict condition that Laban placed upon Jacob. God Jacob the solution to the matter in the dream. gave\r\n\r\n\"And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled. And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I\" Genesis 31:10-11\r\n\r\nGod reveals things to man in the dream mostly about future events. Before Herod could succeed in his evil plan against Jesus, God revealed the matter to Joseph in the dream.\r\n\r\n\"And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.\" Matthew 2:12-13\r\n\r\nGod also uses dream as a message to correct man against any wrongdoing. Dream from God is not usually fearful, but comes with peace compared to other means of dream. and solution\r\n\r\nDREAM THROUGH MAN\r\n\r\nDream from man is usually borne out of one\'s state of mind. I mean the dream that originates from the heart of man. And such a dream often comes with anxieties and is usually baseless or vague.\r\n\r\n\"For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool\'s voice is known by multitude of words\" Eccl. 5:3\r\n\r\n\"For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities: but fear thou God. Eccl.5:7\r\n\r\nA sister told me about the dream she had in her sleep one day. As soon as she finished relating the dream to me, I knew the meaning at once. I asked her whether she thought about what she saw in her dream before she went to sleep, and she said \'Yes\'. And I told her it was purely her state of mind that made her to have that dream.\r\n\r\nSomeone who had probably had a quarrel with another person during the day and bears the grudge in mind till he or she goes to sleep, may likely see the same person in a negative way in his or her dream; and that may lead to a serious problem between them in the physical. Beware of such a dream that is generated from the state of your mind.\r\n\r\nSATANIC DREAM OR NIGHTMARE\r\n\r\nAlmost everything that God created is negatively replicated in the kingdom of darkness. God uses dream to meet the needs of people. But the kingdom of darkness uses negative dreams often called nightmares to destroy people\'s lives. It is basically satanic manipulation to get man distracted from the will of God.\r\n\r\nEveryone that experiences a nightmare must have been attacked by the devil in one way or the other. Many lives, glory and destinies have been destroyed through nightmares.\r\n\r\nThe only person that can set you free from nightmare is God. You need to know Christ if you are yet to accept Him into your life. He is the only sure and genuine avenue for man to be free from every assignment of the devil.\r\n\r\nSIGNS OF A NIGHTMARE\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of darkness has many ways or methods they use in attacking man in the dream. I will only mention few of them.\r\n\r\n1. Sexual intercourse in the dream\r\n\r\n2. Eating in the dream\r\n\r\n3. Being attacked by masquerade(s)\r\n\r\n4. Swimming in the dream\r\n\r\n5. Encountering a road-block\r\n\r\n6. Finding oneself in a road-close\r\n\r\n7. Having your phone SIM card collected in the dream\r\n\r\n8. Doing wedding in the dream\r\n\r\n9. Having your key collected in the dream\r\n\r\n10. A giant standing on your way\r\n\r\n11. Seeing yourself being locked in a dark room\r\n\r\n12. Being denied a right; an opportunity etc.\r\n\r\nWe shall see more of these in the chapter of prayers.\r\n\r\nOne thing I know for sure is that whether the devil likes it or not, you shall be victorious against all satanic dreams in Jesus\' mighty name.', 'Dream Interpretation\r\n\r\nD ream is a spiritual event and also a mystery that is beyond the understanding of a natural man. Dream comes like a physical television that people watch; yet it is quite different as it is more spiritual in nature.\r\n\r\nTwo people cannot watch an event that unfolds in a\r\n\r\ndream at a time; rather it can only be experienced by\r\n\r\none person at a given time while asleep. It is a\r\n\r\nspiritual mystery of God that goes beyond the level\r\n\r\nof an ordinary person.\r\n\r\nTalking about dream interpretation; there is no one that can interpret a dream correctly without the help of the Holy Spirit. Supposing it was possible to interpret a dream without the power of the Holy Spirit, the so-called magicians and wise men of Egypt that Pharaoh invited to interpret his dream could have succeeded in doing so, before Joseph was involved. But they could not interpret the king\'s dream because they lacked the Spirit of the living God.\r\n\r\n\"And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river. And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favored kine and fat fleshed; and they fed in a meadow.And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favored and lean fleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river.\r\n\r\nAnd the ill favored and lean fleshed kine did eat up the seven well favored and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke. And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good. And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.\r\n\r\nAnd the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream. And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh. \"Genesis 41:1-8\r\n\r\nâ€œAnd Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it. And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace. \"Verses 15-16\r\n\r\nJoseph here makes Pharaoh to understand that dream interpretation belongs to God. Let us also consider king Nebuchadnezzar. The king had a dream but could not understand it, let alone know its interpretation. So he sent for all the people he believed had the supernatural endowment to tell him the dream he had; but none of them could tell him; rather they tried to be smart by asking him to relate the dream first and then they would be able to interpret it to him.\r\n\r\n\"And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him. Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the Sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king. And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream. Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation. The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill. But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof. They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it. The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me. But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof. The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king\'s matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.\" - Daniel 2:1-10\r\n\r\nThe message of the king got to Daniel late and for that reason he told the king to give him and his fellows three days, by which time they would tell him his dream and also interpret it.\r\n\r\nDaniel knew that humanly speaking, there was no man that could carry out such an assignment without the help of God\'s Spirit.\r\n\r\n\"For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain. Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king\'s guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:He answered and said to Arioch the king\'s captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel. Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation. Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions: That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.\r\n\r\nThen was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven\" Daniel 2:12-19\r\n\r\n\"Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king; But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dreams, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;\" Verses 27-28\r\n\r\nThe Omniscient God revealed the dream to Daniel and others and they went to the king, told him the dream he had and the interpretation.\r\n\r\n\"Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him. The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.\" Daniel 2:46-47\r\n\r\nDon\'t forget that dream moves or occurs with the situations around us. Dream can come in different ways but conveys the same meaning. Anyone that wants to interpret dreams accurately must have a good relationship with the Holy Spirit, and of course possess the full spirit of the living God. In other words, he or she must first be a true child of God and be filled with His Spirit.\r\n\r\nA woman once came to me to relate the dream she had. In the dream she said she saw a heavy fire. But when she told a man about the dream, he said the fire she saw was the Holy Ghost fire. She decided to come to me, as she was not pleased with the man\'s interpretation of the dream. I told her that the Holy Spirit would help us to interpret it. To the glory of God, Holy Spirit revealed the meaning of the dream to me; and I told the woman that she needed to pray against sudden death. It was God that saved the woman. Good and correct interpretations of dreams come from the Holy Spirit that knows everything\r\n\r\n\"And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you\r\n\r\nforever. \"John 14:26\r\n\r\nHoly Spirit is the Master of all things. Nothing is hidden from Him. Every believer needs Him before he or she can succeed in the Christian journey in life. He is indispensable to you and me. Nothing is impossible for Him.', 'Solution\r\n\r\nThere is no problem in life without a solution. But then it depends on how you go about the problem. The only way that guarantees a permanent solution is that of the Lord.\r\n\r\n\"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\" Matthew 11:28-30 \r\n\r\nThe Scripture makes us to understand that everyone that goes to God for a solution over any challenge he or she may be going through, will have a testimony.\r\n\r\nJesus Christ in the above Bible passage is asking us to come to Him with our challenges or problems and He\'s assuring us we\'ll never be disappointed as we do so. No one goes to him for a solution for his or her problem that will not have a testimony.\r\n\r\nWhat is that power that is contending with you in your dream? Present the case before God and you will be delivered completely.\r\n\r\n\"And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me\". Psalm 50:15.\r\n\r\nGod is waiting for in the prayer room to present your case before Him for a permanent solution. Nothing is impossible for Him. \"Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is\r\n\r\nthere any thing too hard for me?\" Jeremiah 32:27\r\n\r\n\"But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.\" Matthew 19:26\r\n\r\nNo one can help you to solve your problem but God, who is Almighty in every situation you can ever imagine. Before you can receive a solution to your case, therefore, God is demanding one thing from you.\r\n\r\n\"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. \"John 3:16\r\n\r\nAnd the only thing God is demanding from you is that you need to embrace the love of God, by accepting Jesus into your life.\r\n\r\nChrist died on the Cross of Calvary for the remission of our sins.\r\n\r\n\"But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\" Romans 5:8\r\n\r\nSo the first step before anything else is to give your life to Jesus and you shall be empowered to become the son and daughter of God.\r\n\r\n\"But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name\" John 1:12\r\n\r\nAnd don\'t forget that to make that your good dream (desire) to come to pass, you need Jesus in your life as well. There is no solution in any other place except in Christ Jesus. Accept Him into your life before the time of grace is over. Remember that there is time for everything.\r\n\r\n\"To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: \"- Eccl. 3:1\r\n\r\nThis is the time of salvation and God is expecting you to bring your yokes unto Him, because He is a destroyer of yokes. Don\'t delay your miracle. tomorrow might be too late.\r\n\r\nGod loves you; accept Him into your life today and your name shall be written in the book of life. Come to God today, as He has a solution to every problem in life.', 'Prayers\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. \"Matthew 7:7-8\r\n\r\nGod is ever ready to hear your request; but you are the one that is not ready to talk to your Creator that can do all things.\r\n\r\nWHAT IS PRAYER?\r\n\r\nPrayer is a way of communicating with God or presenting your desire or need to Him. Hannah the mother of Samuel presented her case before God.\r\n\r\n\"And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her month. Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken. And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee. And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.\"1 Samuel 1:12-15\r\n\r\nWhatever you want God to do in your life, must first go through the channel of prayer. As I usually say; God that answers prayers is in the prayer room but looking for someone that can pray. If God blesses you in the dream; before the manifestation of that blessing in the physical, you need to pray. And if you experience a nightmare in your sleep, before you can overcome, you need prayer. Prayer is very essential in the Christian journey.\r\n\r\nNow we\'ll be considering all the promises of God and the attacks of the devil, one after the other with necessary prayers.\r\n\r\nGODLY DREAMS\r\n\r\nDon\'t forget that every good dream comes from God. And for that good dream to come to reality in your life, there are spiritual steps you need to take.\r\n\r\nAdequate information from the Word of God, as well as fasting and prayer with unwavering faith in the God of all possibilities are necessary to make your good dream to come true.\r\n\r\nSATANIC DREAM OR NIGHTMARE\r\n\r\nAny dream that frightens or causes any kind of distress is from Satan: and such is called a nightmare.\r\n\r\nThe following are the likely dreams and the way out:\r\n\r\n1. SEXUAL INTERCOURSE IN THE DREAM:\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of darkness is using sex in the dream to invite sickness into the life of the victim and to destroy his or her glory.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION:\r\n\r\nâš« 4 days fasting and prayer\r\n\r\nBible reading: Psalms 3,7,46 and 109\r\n\r\nPRAY THAT:\r\n\r\nGod should expose the source of that nightmare and the demon that supervised it.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ God should destroy the satanic dream and deliver you completely.\r\n\r\n2. EATING IN THE DREAM:\r\n\r\nEveryone that eats in the dream will experience the attack of the devil, and satanic arrows are thereby planted in such a life and his or her destiny will be changed against the will of God.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION:\r\n\r\nâš« 3 days\' fasting and p prayer\r\n\r\nBible reading: Psalms 2, 4, 20 and 24\r\n\r\nPRAY THAT:\r\n\r\nâš« God should expose the agent of Satan that is feeding you in the dream.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ God should destroy their evil weapons in your body.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ God should arise and fight your battle.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ God should flush out every evil food in your life.\r\n\r\n God should grant you total deliverance.\r\n\r\n3. ATTACK OF MASQUERADE IN THE DREAM:\r\n\r\nSeeing masquerade in the dream is another way the power of darkness is using to attack the people of God.\r\n\r\nWhoever that sees a masquerade pursing him or her in the dream signifies he or she has a particular glory the power of darkness are after to destroy. The enemies use cloth or mask to cover their faces against anyone they want to fight, in order to hide their identities.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION:\r\n\r\nâš« 3 days\' fasting and prayer\r\n\r\nBible Reading: Psalms 2,3,68 and 118:10-12\r\n\r\nPRAY THAT:\r\n\r\nâ€¢ God should expose the agents of Satan that use evil clothes or masks to cover their faces to attack you in the dream.\r\n\r\nGod should set on fire the evil clothes that the agent of darkness is using to manipulate your life.\r\n\r\nGod should destroy their evil covenant in your life.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ All their evil assignment against you should catch fire in Jesus\' name.\r\n\r\n4. SWIMMING IN THE DREAM:\r\n\r\nMany people have never set their eyes on the ocean in the physical realm, but they often see themselves swimming inside it in the dream. Swimming in the dream can be interpreted in two ways in the life of man. Some that find themselves swimming in the dream may be members of the marine kingdom. The satanic assignment against the second category of swimmers in the dream is to block and surround their lives with an evil ocean of problems.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION:\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Marine Spirit - 7 Days\' fasting and prayer\r\n\r\nBible Reading: Psalms 2, 18, 68\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Attack of an evil ocean in the dream:\r\n\r\n4 days\' fasting and prayer\r\n\r\nBible reading: Psalms 3, 51 and 68\r\n\r\nPRAY THAT:\r\n\r\nâš« God should arise and fight the marine spirit that is fighting you.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ God should arise with the power of resurrection and deliver your inner man from the marine kingdom.\r\n\r\nGod should dry the evil water before you.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Every evil weapon of the marine powers on your way should catch fire in Jesus\' mighty name.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ God should grant you total deliverance.\r\n\r\n5. ROAD-BLOCK IN THE DREAM:\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of darkness uses a road-block in the dream to stop someone from experiencing a breakthrough or making progress.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION:\r\n\r\nâš«4 days\' fasting and prayer\r\n\r\nBible Reading: Psalms 3, 24 and 107\r\n\r\nPRAYER:\r\n\r\nâš« Father, destroy every barrier or blockage of darkness on my way.\r\n\r\nFather, arise and open every way that the enemy has blocked against me.\r\n\r\nâš« God, you are the way to fulfillment, don\'t allow darkness to block my way.\r\n\r\nFather, let the power of resurrection fight for me.\r\n\r\nLord, deliver me from every confusion of the devil.\r\n\r\nâš« Lord, take all glory over me.\r\n\r\n6. ROAD CLOSE OR END OF THE ROAD IN THE DREAM:\r\n\r\nThis simply means putting an end to someone\'s journey in life through satanic hand writing.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION:\r\n\r\nâš« 3 days\' fasting and Prayer\r\n\r\nBible Reading: Psalms 35, 68 and 105\r\n\r\nPRAYER:\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Every evil assignment of darkness against my journey in life, be destroyed in Jesus\' name.\r\n\r\nâš« Father, the agents of darkness were not there when you sent me to the world, they must not know my end in life.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Every arrow of sudden death in my life, be destroyed in Jesus\' mighty name.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Father, arise today and let your shelter cover me.\r\n\r\nEvery evil sacrifice the enemy had carried against my journey in life, catch fire in Jesus\' name.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Blood of Jesus deliver my life from destiny changers.\r\n\r\nFather, let your mark be upon me.\r\n\r\n7. WEDDING IN THE DREAM:\r\n\r\nWhoever that weds in the dream, is under the trap of the devil for destruction.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION:\r\n\r\nâš« 4 days\' white fasting and prayer\r\n\r\nBible Reading: Psalms 4, 68 and 109\r\n\r\nPRAYER:\r\n\r\nFather, I thank you because all power in heaven and on earth belongs to you.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Father, deliver me from every evil program of the devil.\r\n\r\nâš« Father, destroy every evil covenant of the devil in my night season.\r\n\r\nâš« God, don\'t allow the kingdom of darkness to be victorious over me.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Father, destroy every channel of darkness into my life.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Lord, don\'t let me die for enemy to rejoice.\r\n\r\nâš« Lord, use the power of resurrection to deliver me\r\n\r\n8. HAVING YOUR KEY COLLECTED IN THE DREAM:\r\n\r\nIt\'s not good when someone\'s key is collected in the dream.

GIANT ON YOUR WAY IN THE DREAM:\r\n\r\nWhoever that is due for promotion breakthrough and sees a giant standing on his or her way in the dream, needs to pray seriously as it will be difficult to achieve this.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION:\r\n\r\nâ€¢ 4 days\' white fasting and prayer\r\n\r\nBible Reading: Psalms 2, 3, 29 and 118:10-12; Zach 4:6\r\n\r\nPRAYER:\r\n\r\nâš« Lord, I thank you because you are greater than the greatest of the world.\r\n\r\nâš« Father, forgive all the sins that I committed that\r\n\r\nhave made a giant to stand on my way.\r\n\r\nI command in the name of Jesus, that every giant that is standing on my way to fall flat.\r\n\r\n.

BEING LOCKED IN A DARK ROOM IN THE DREAM:\r\n\r\nWhenever you see yourself in the dream being locked up; it means that your inner man has been imprisoned in the spiritual realm. It takes the mighty hands of God for you to get delivered.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION:\r\n\r\nâš« 7 days\' fasting and prayer\r\n\r\nBible Reading: Psalms 10, 18 and 24\r\n\r\nPRAYER:\r\n\r\nâš« Lord, I thank you because you are able to deliver me from every oppression of the devil.\r\n\r\n.

SEEING A RED OBJECT IN THE DREAM:\r\n\r\nThis is another medium the power of darkness is using to abort the glory of God in the lives of people. If you are hoping in God for the fruit of the womb for example, and see a red object in your dream, such pregnancy may automatically lead to a miscarriage.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION:\r\n\r\nâš« 5 days\' fasting and prayer; serious deliverance prayer.\r\n\r\nBible Reading: Psalms 3, 4, 68 and 70; Isaiah 8:10-12,54:17\r\n\r\nPRAYER:\r\n\r\nLord, I thank you because no weapon formed against me shall prosper.\r\n\r\nâš« Father, deliver me from every oppression of sin.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Lord, expose every hidden object that Satan is using to attack me.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Lord, destroy every evil object of Satan in my life.\r\n\r\nâš«Lord, destroy every covenant with any evil object in my life.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Every red object in my dream, be destroyed in Jesus\' name.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Lord, deliver me from evil chains of darkness.\r\n\r\n13. SEEING YOURSELF IN THE VILLAGE; FORMER PRIMARY SCHOOL OR A ROUGH PLACE:\r\n\r\nMany people do experience this in the dream. They see themselves in their village or former primary school; while they are at present residing in an urban place or occupying a higher level. Such a dream is satanic manipulation of someone\'s destiny.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION:\r\n\r\nâš« 7 days\' fasting and prayer of deliverance\r\n\r\nBible reading: Psalms 4, 46 and 70; Mat. 13:24-25; Colossians 2:14-15; Phil. 2:9-12\r\n\r\nPRAYER:\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Lord, I thank you for your special love towards me\r\n\r\nâš« Lord, deliver me completely from every arrow of sin.\r\n\r\nLord, deliver me from the village of slavery that the enemy has kept me.\r\n\r\nFather, don\'t let the enemy succeed in their plans\r\n\r\nagainst me.\r\n\r\nFather, send down your angel to deliver me from the village of darkness.\r\n\r\nEvery evil power of darkness that is standing against me, be destroyed in Jesus\' name.\r\n\r\nFather, set me free with the power of resurrection.\r\n\r\n14. COLLECT OR SPEND MONEY IN THE DREAM:\r\n\r\nThis is another manipulation of the kingdom of darkness, by giving money to people in the dream. They use this means to destroy the finances of their victims.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION:\r\n\r\nâš« 5 days\' fasting and prayer\r\n\r\nBible Reading: Psalms 2, 4, 27 and 70\r\n\r\nPRAYER:\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Lord, I thank you because you are the source of my life.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Lord, forgive me of the sin of tithes and offerings I have committed.\r\n\r\nâš« Lord, deliver my finances from the kingdom of darkness.\r\n\r\n. Every arrow shot against my finances, catch fire in Jesus\' mighty name.\r\n\r\n. Father, break every covenant that stands against\r\n\r\nmy finances.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Father, put an end to hardship in my life.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Lord, restore the glory of my finances that the enemy had taken away from my life.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Father, open every door of breakthrough for me in Jesus\' mighty name.\r\n\r\n15. OVERCOMING SPIRITUAL COBWEB OF DARKNESS:\r\n\r\nPhysical cobweb is normal, because it is woven by spiders. But the power of darkness uses it to destroy people\'s lives spiritually. Just imagine a situation where someone runs into cobwebs in the same place many people must have passed. It is a spiritual attack of the devil.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION:\r\n\r\nâš« 4 days\' fasting and prayer\r\n\r\nBible reading: Psalms 3, 29, 97 and 99\r\n\r\nPRAYER:\r\n\r\nâš« Lord, I thank you for your greatness in my life.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Lord, deliver me from every sin that has made me a prey to the kingdom of darkness.\r\n\r\nâš« Lord, deliver me from every evil cobweb that is blocking my way.\r\n\r\nHoly Ghost fire, arise and consume every cobwe of darkness on my way.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Lord, let my way be opened today with t mighty hands of God.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Father, let your fire go before me today.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Father, destroy every object of Satan on me today.\r\n\r\nThe only person that can deliver you and me from every attack of the devil is the almighty God.\r\n\r\n\"And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.\" Matt. 28:18\r\n\r\nThere is no power that you can compare with the power of God. He is Omniscience, Omnipresence and all in all. And He is greater than the greatest of this world. He is a mighty God; no wonder He called Himself\'I AM THAT IAM\' to Moses.\r\n\r\n\"And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, IAM hath sent me unto you.\" \"Exodus 3:14\r\n\r\nThere is no problem or satanic yoke that you take to God that His power is not able to dismantle. God is calling you today; don\'t hesitate to honour His call. His Word says: \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\"\r\n\r\nMatthew 11:28-30\r\n\r\nThat problem or challenge in your life does not glorify God; and it\'s not His original plan for you, but purely the deceit and manipulation of the devil.\r\n\r\nCome unto Jesus for total deliverance and you will have every cause to glorify the name of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBooks by THE SAME AUTHOR\r\n\r\n1.

God told Abram that, as he could see, so shall be given unto him, meaning that, you cannot possess or achieve what you don\'t see.\r\nThank God Abram was able to see and he possessed what he saw. Genesis 13:14-15\r\nMany desires one success or the other and they engage in serious prayer, but they never saw the success come into reality. Abram saw it before he could achieve it, am not condemning prayer, you need to have the vision before the assignment of prayer. Vision plus prayer will give you the right answer.\r\nVision means spiritual dream or imagination of what you desire to achieve in life.\r\nThe inspiration of God is the source of good vision, Nehemiah had the vision to rebuild the wall of Jerusalem. It is one thing to have a vision and another thing to know how to go about it.\r\nA lot of people have great vision but lack the analysis. Vision makes the journey juicy if is being interpreted rightly.\r\nTry as much as possible to discover and analysis your God given vision for your life. You shall get there in Jesus mighty name.

And God said, let us make man in our own image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the flesh of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, \r\n27. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.\r\n28. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.\r\nThe steps God took in creation of man was great, no wonder, man is fearfully and wonderfully made, Psalm 139:14:\r\n14. I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvelous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.\r\nBefore sin came to the life of man, he was perfectly made, reasoning and doing things in godly way, unfortunately for man sin changed everything.\r\nGlory to the name of God that sent His only begotten son to the world to die for our sins. Through the power of redemption, the sonship of man was restored. John 1:12.\r\n12. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name\r\nGlory to the name of Jesus Christ that set man free from everlasting punishment and death.\r\nTHREE IN ONE\r\nMan is unique in creation, he was greatly created far better than other creatures, he carried the image and likeness of God, no other creature has that. Man is three in one, that is; spirit, soul and body and our creator is trinity, that is, God the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit, man is also three in one, in other words like father like son.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPIRIT: \r\nThe spirit in man is the light that illuminates both the soul and body and the two cannot be alive without the spirit. The spirit brings dead things to life, it makes the body and soul to function properly. Without the spirit in man nothing can function.\r\nGod relates with man through the spirit, because our God is a spirit being, man cannot relate with God without the spirit.\r\nJohn 4:23-24:\r\n23. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.\r\n24. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.\r\nThe spirit in man play vital role in the existence of man on earth. The three works together in order to achieve success in man.\r\nSOUL:\r\nThe scripture makes it interchangeable, either soul, heart or mind but scientifically it was detailed. What I want us to know is that, the soul of man is the center of reasoning, seat of wisdom or the workshop of thought. It is the possessor of words either good or bad, no wonder, the bible warns us to guide it against evil words that can lead to wrong thoughts.\r\nProverbs 4:23:\r\n23. Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.\r\nThe heart of man is very sensitive to everything that entered it. Guide your heart against any ungodly matters that can pollute the place. The books you read, films you watch or group you keep matters to your heart. It is the heart of man that produces every action that the body carries out.\r\nProverbs 23:7:\r\n7. For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he....\r\nThe people around you are mindful of you because you have the right mind. The Soul is very vital to man, therefore, guide it.\r\nBODY:\r\nThe body of man is the suit that covers both the soul and spirit, all the thought that comes out of the heart of man, the body carries it out and the spirit gives life to the body in order to take action. The three works together to have a complete man. 1Thessalonians 5:23. The plan of God for you is to prosper and enjoy sound health. The three came together to maximize the God given vision.\r\nAny success that man may achieve comes from the support of the spirit, soul and body. The spirit must give light while soul thinks it out and the body gives action for it to manifest. They are indispensable to each other. The power of creativity connects the three together in order to maximize the full goal of a man.', 'Vision\r\nNo one is created empty rather full of great potential and vision. It is the level of your vision that makes people to be mindful of you in the society. Life without vision is full of frustration and confusion.\r\nWhat is Vision?\r\nDictionary meaning - faculty or state to see beyond present level.\r\nBiblically - It means something seen in a dream, trance or religious ecstasy, especially a supernatural appearance that usually conveys a revelation.\r\nWhat you sense or perceive in your heart over a certain goal is what is called vision.\r\nA person like Nehemiah had the vision to build the wall of Jerusalem and he had the full support of the king to build the wall.\r\nNehemiah 2:1-7\r\n1 And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been before time sad in his presence.\r\n2 Wherefore the king said unto me, why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? This is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,\r\n3 And said unto the king, let the king live forever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers\' sepulchers, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?\r\n4 Then the king said unto me, for what dost thou made request? So, I prayed to the God of heaven.\r\n5 And I said unto the king, if it pleases the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers\' sepulchers, that I may build it.\r\n6 And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) for how long shall thy journey be? And when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.\r\n7 Moreover I said unto the king, if it pleases the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah.\r\nHe shared the vision with the king how he could not sleep, that is the nature of a man that has vision, nothing can stop them from manifesting.\r\nImagine what small David did when he heard about Goliath, there is no mountain that a man with a vision cannot pull down. David was not moved about who Goliath was but the vision was pushing him to do something and deliver his generation from the wicked Philistine.\r\nDavid went to the king and told him what he saw at the war front, king Saul and others thought David could not do anything but the vision was pushing him to do something. Lo and behold, David succeeded. If you can pursue your vision you shall succeed in Jesus precious name. AMEN.\r\n1Samuel 17:29-33.\r\n29 And David said, what have I now done? Is there not a cause?\r\n30 And he turned from him towards another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.\r\n31 And when the word was heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him\r\n32 And David said to Saul, let no man\'s heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.\r\n33 And Saul said to David, thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he is a man of war from his youth.\r\nVision has nothing to do with your age, whether you are young or old. King Saul thought David was too young for such assignment but vision qualified him that he could defeat Goliath and it was so. What David was seeing was quite different from what his brethren and king Saul were seeing, the vision showed David how giant he was to Goliath but his brethren and king Saul saw a small boy, that is the power of vision in the life of a man that has vision. Another thing about a man with vision is that, you cannot change their mind, king Saul tried to equip the mind of David not to go and fight Goliath, he could not quit the battle because of the fire of vision that was burning in him. It is not easy to change the mind of a visionary man against his or her vision, this is because they have the full backing of God to fulfil their visions.\r\n1Samuel 17:37-39.\r\n37 David said moreover, the Lord that delivered me from the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, go, and the Lord be with you\r\n38 And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail\r\n39 And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.\r\nDavid made the king to understand that, God that gave him victory over bear and lion would surely deliver him from the hand of Goliath that troubled Israel.\r\nKing Saul tried to equipped David with the weapons of war against Goliath, but unfortunately, David could not use them, this means that, the method or system another person used to fulfill his vision might not work for your own vision. David could not use the weapons because he had never used such weapons. The way he saw the vision is totally different from the eyes the king had used to behold the matter.\r\nEvery vision carries the method or system of operations, never use another person\'s method of operation rather use the system you understand the most, which is definitely God\'s system. I pray for you in the name of Jesus Christ your God given vision will not enter into the hands of vision killers. David never allowed king Saul method of operation, he followed the leading of the Holy Spirit and he succeeded. You too shall succeed in the name of Jesus Christ.\r\nYour vision is in your hands, don\'t allow it to be destroyed. God that supported Nehemiah, David and others will surely support you to fulfillment in the mighty name of Jesus. Amen.', 'Analysis\r\nOne thing is to have a vision and another thing is to know how to analysis it. Many people claim to have vision but the analysis is the greatest challenge they are facing.\r\nPsalm 32:8-9\r\n8 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shall go: I will guide the with mine eye\r\n9 Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee. \r\nFor everything you do, if you don\'t follow the instructions that entails it, you will surely do it wrongly. Even the scripture makes us to understand that, we should write down the vision and make it plain, which means that, study the vision and have the understanding before taking any steps.\r\nHabakkuk 2:2-4.\r\n2 And the Lord answered me, and said, write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.\r\n3 For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end, it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.\r\n4 Behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.\r\nThe time I had the vision to work in God\'s vine yard, I sought for more knowledge on how to go about it, I followed all these points we are about to consider, the analysis really helped me till date. I was able to interpret the vision rightly and there is no amount spent on a vision analyzed that is wasted. Pay full attention to vision analysis for greater fulfillment.\r\nThere is the analysis you need to know and understand about visions, we shall be considering them one after the other. WHAT, WHERE, HOW AND WHEN.\r\nWHAT\r\nThe scripture says write down the vision and make it plain. The first thing you need to consider is WHAT, which means: what does God want you to do about the dream or vision you are seeing. It is not good enough to have vision and not know how actualize It.\r\nWhen God called Abram to depart from his father\'s house and go to where he would show him, immediately he obeyed the voice of God for his life.\r\nGenesis 12:1-4.\r\n1 Now the Lord had said unto Abram, get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father\'s house, unto a land I will shew thee.\r\n2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shall be a blessing:\r\n3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.\r\n4 So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed from Haran\r\nThe first thing God showed Abram was to go out to a place He would show him. He was able to discover what God wanted him to do. You need to know what God wants you to do before engaging yourself into an unprofitable assignment. \r\nWHERE\r\nIf you discover what God wants you to do, you need to discover the location to fulfill the assignment. God told Isaac not to depart from the land of the Philistine to Egypt and he obeyed the voice of God.\r\nGenesis 26:2-3.\r\n2 And the Lord appeared unto him, and said, go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of\r\n3 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and I will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I swear unto Abraham thy father\r\nIn that land there was no rain, the people of the land could not farm because there was no rain, but God told Isaac to stay in such land, to the glory of God he succeeded, because he was in a right location. Vision that lack right location will lack the provision of God. That will not be your portion in Jesus mighty name. Amen\r\nAfter discovering what he asked you to do, take a step to the next analysis.\r\nHOW\r\nThere is a system or method of making things done, if you don\'t follow the instructions, you will never get the right answer. The mother of Jesus told the servants that whatever he asked them to do, they should do it.\r\nJohn 2:5.\r\n5 His mother saith unto the servants, whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.\r\nJust like the subject called mathematics, if you don\'t follow the formula properly, you will never get the right answer to the question.\r\nAnother thing is that, if you don\'t ask or pray for the right method to use to fulfill the assignment, another person will give you another alternative that will destroy the vision. \r\nThere was a time the vision of God for my life would have hit the rock through wrong method they gave me, which was not the method of God for my vision. Desist from wrong method and follow the right one.\r\nWHEN\r\nThe book of Ecclesiastes says; there is time for everything in life. Ask for your own time and wait for your time. Every vision has the period of time that is allocated to it.\r\nEcclesiastes 3:1.\r\nTo everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven.\r\nThe God we are serving works with time, at the appointed time, God sent our Lord Jesus to the world, Galatians 4:4.\r\n4 But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, under the law\r\nWhat about Jesus Christ, when the wine finished, His mother told him about the challenge of wine they were facing, Jesus told his mother that, it was not the right time for him to operate.\r\nJohn 2:4.\r\n4 Jesus saith unto her, woman, what have I to do with thee? Mine hour is not yet come\r\nIf God could honour time, who are we not to follow the right time of God. Many visions had been truncated due to wrong timing. The energy many would have used to do the right thing at right time had been exhausted. Wait for the right time of God and stop imitating others. You can never get to fulfillment with the wrong time. Amend your vision before it is too late.\r\nBy taking these four points into action, am very sure that your success and fulfillment are guaranteed. You will not fail your generation neither disappoint your God in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.', 'Interpreter\r\nIt takes a person to have a vision and majority to interpret the vision into fulfillment. It was Joseph that God used to help Potiphar fulfil some part of his vision.\r\nGenesis 39:2-4.\r\n2 And the Lord was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.\r\n3 And his master saw that the Lord was with him, and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand \r\n4 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put in his hand.\r\nBefore his master would commit things to his hands; he would have seen something he could not achieve before his arrival. Immediately Joseph got to his house, everything changed.\r\nNehemiah was not the only person that could build the wall of Jerusalem, but he was the only one that saw the vision, many people interpreted it to fulfillment.\r\nNehemiah 3:1-10.\r\n1 Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they builded the sheep gate, they sanctified it and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananeel\r\n2 And next unto him builded the men of Jericho, and next unto them builded Zaccur the son of Imri\r\n3 But the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who also laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof and the bars thereof.\r\n4 And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz. And next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabeel. And next unto them repaired Zadok the son of Baana.\r\n5 And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their God.\r\n6 Moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the bars thereof\r\n7 And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the man of Gibeon, and Mizpah, unto the throne of the governor on this side the river\r\n8 Next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of the goldsmiths. Next unto him also repaired Hananiah the son of one of the apothecaries, and they fortified Jerusalem unto the broad wall\r\n9 And next unto them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem.\r\n10 And next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, even over against his house. And next unto him repaired Hattush the son of Hashabniah.\r\nThere are some visions that are more than a nation, by the time interpreters comes in and every one interpreted their portion, a nation will not be able to contain it.\r\n1Corinthians 8:2.\r\n2. And if any man think he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.\r\nNo one is master all, because you are the visionary person does not mean you know everything, the journey of life is chained together. You need someone and someone else need you for certain things.\r\nMoses was the only person that received a call from God to take the people of Israel to the promised land but, he wasn\'t the only one that fulfilled the assignment, other people were involved.\r\nNumbers 11:16-17.\r\n16. And the Lord said unto Moses, gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with thee.\r\n17. And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and I will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.\r\nIt was God that told Moses to choose seventy people that could work with him in order to fulfill the vision of God for his life.\r\nWHAT IS INTERPRETATION?\r\nInterpretation means the translation of a thing, while interpreter means a person that translate words, dreams or vision. Joseph was the first interpreter in the scripture. He interpreted dreams in the prison and also in the palace of Pharaoh. He used the gift of interpretation to contribute to the vision of Pharaoh.\r\nGenesis 40:9-14\r\n9. And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, in my dream, behold, a vine was before me;\r\n10. And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossom shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:\r\n11. And Pharaoh\'s cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh\'s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh\'s hand.\r\n12. And Joseph said unto him, this is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days:\r\n13. Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh\'s cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.\r\n14. But think of me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house\r\nGenesis 41:14-16\r\n14. Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh \r\n15. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream and interpret it.\r\n16. And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, it is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.\r\nA good advice for you as a visionary person is that, pray well for God to connect you to the right interpreter that will help your vision to grow to higher ground. Joseph was the right interpreter to the dream of Pharaoh, if another person had given the interpretation of the dream, the vision would have been destroyed through wrong interpretation.\r\nWhat about Daniel and his colleagues, they were good interpreters that affected the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar positively. Daniel 2:1-20.\r\nThe gift of interpretation is a special grace that God bestowed upon Joseph, Daniel and his friends. What ordinary people and astrologers could not do, God did it through them. I pray, special grace of interpretation of your vision shall come upon you in Jesus name. Amen.\r\nLiving an isolated life cannot fulfil the vision you carry, rather, live among like minded people. God will connect you to the people that will help you interpret your vision in a godly way in Jesus name. Amen.', 'Divine Support\r\nAlmost everyone on earth desire success in their field. No good vision without help from above,\r\nPsalm 121:1.\r\nII will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.\r\nDivine support simply means having the back up of God in every area of your life. Our father Abram enjoyed divine support. Genesis 12:14. Success was very cheap for him to achieve, no one encounters divine support and remains the same. One of the steps that helped Abram was that, he obeyed God\'s command to the last. Many people desire help from above but finds it difficult to obey divine instructions from God.\r\nIsaac the son of Abraham also enjoyed divine support of God in a strange land where there was no rain not to talk of planting of crops. With the full support of God on Isaac, he planted and harvested hundredfold.\r\nGenesis 26: 10-12.\r\n10. And Abimelech said, what is this that thou hast done unto us? One of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.\r\n11. And Abimelech charged all the people, saying, he that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.\r\n12. Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year and hundredfold: and the Lord blessed him\r\nJoseph also received divine support from above in the house of Potiphar, prison and in the palace of king Pharaoh, he had successful journey and God was with him in all his ways. \r\nGenesis 39:1-4, 20-23,41:38-45. \r\n1 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hand of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.\r\n2 And the Lord was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.\r\n3 And his master saw that the Lord was with him, and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand.\r\n4 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put in his hand.\r\n20. And Joseph\'s master took him, and put him in the prison, a place where kings prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.\r\n21. But the Lord was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.\r\n22. And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.\r\n23. The keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand; because the Lord was with him, and that which he did, the Lord made it to prosper.\r\nGenesis 41:38-45\r\n38. And Pharaoh said unto his servants, can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the spirit of God is?\r\n39. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:\r\n40. Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.\r\n41. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, see, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.\r\n42. And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph\'s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck.\r\n43. And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.\r\n44. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.\r\n45. And Pharaoh called Joseph\'s name Zaphnathpaaneah and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over the all the land of Egypt.\r\nGod supported David to defeat Goliath, humanly speaking David could not, but he sought for divine support and God helped him to defeat the giant that stood against Israel.\r\n1Samuel 17:43-47.\r\n43. And the Philistine said unto David, am la dog, that thou comest to me with staves?\r\nAnd the Philistine cursed David by his gods.\r\n44. And the Philistine said unto David, come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.\r\n45. Then said David to the Philistine, thou comest unto me with a sword and a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.\r\n46. This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistine this day unto the fowls of the air, and the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is God in Israel\r\n47. And all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword and with spear: for the battle is the Lord\'s, and he will give you into our hands.\r\n It is good to discover God\'s given vision and have the full backing of God. The divine support of God has three keys that are vital to your vision. Psalm 32:8. They are: Instructions, Teach and Guide\r\nInstructions\r\nEvery child of God needs the help of the Holy spirit to instruct them on how to succeed their God given vision. Some thought they knew everything, they are yet to know vital things from God. Never believe that, once you discover the vision of God for your life, nothing more, I want to tell you that, there are more to know from God.\r\n1Corinthians 8:2.\r\n2. And if any man think that he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.\r\nTeach\r\nThe greatest teacher ever seen is the Holy spirit. The scripture says, He shall teach you all things. The Holy Spirit is indispensable to all believers that desires success in their vision.\r\nJohn 14:26.\r\n26. But the comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance, whatsoever I have send unto you.\r\nGuide\r\nThe third key is for God to guide you with his eyes, help in correcting your mistakes and also to fight against any attack from the kingdom of darkness. You and I need the full backing of God in all our ways in order to succeed our journey in life.\r\nThere are steps you need to put in to consideration, we shall be taking these points one after the other, Proverbs 15:3.\r\n3. The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good\r\nGod will not let you alone without being guided with his eyes against any mistakes or devil\'s attack. Don\'t forget that, we are limited in all things but we have the God that is unlimited in all things and he can support us in all ways. Let us seek his support. \r\nPROCEDURES FOR DIVINE SUPPORT\r\nThere are steps many people need to take in order to have divine support. We shall be taking them one after the other.\r\nSonship: The Devil and sin has taken the sonship of man in the garden of Eden. Man became helpless in all things. We give all glory to the name of our God that sent his only begotten son to die for our sins and also deliver us from Satan and sin,\r\nRomans 5:8.\r\n8. But God commandeth his love towards us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\r\nIt was the love of God and the blood of Jesus Christ that redeemed man back to his sonship, John 3:16. Christ died on the cross of Calvary for your sins, accept him in to your life and your name shall be written in the book of life and you shall be called the son and daughter of God, John 1:12.\r\nFaith\r\nIt is your faith that makes your salvation sure before your Creator. Truly you are saved by grace but through the expression of your faith, simply put, no faith, no salvation.\r\nEphesians 2:8.\r\n8. For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God.\r\nGod gives more honour to your faith than any spiritual exercise. The scripture says have faith, Mark 11: 22 and walk by faith, 2Corinthians 5:7. Your Christian journey is impotent without faith. Have faith in God.\r\nHoliness\r\nWe are serving a holy God and He expect holiness from you. You need to present yourself holy unto the Lord before you can enjoy divine support. Holiness will make you relevant to spiritual things.\r\nRomans 12:1-2\r\nI I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.\r\n2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that prove what is that good and acceptable, and perfect will of God\r\nWord of God\r\nThere is nothing you can compare with the word of God, it stands forever. God told Joshua not to depart from the book of the law, because it is full of success and prosperity. Study, eat and meditate on the word, and you shall enjoy the divine support from above.\r\nJoshua 1:8\r\n8 This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shall meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shall make thy way prosperous, and then thou shall have good success.\r\n\r\n\r\nEffective Prayer\r\nThere is a saying that our God is always in the prayer room, whereas, he is looking for someone that can pray. Prayer is a means of communicating with God. How effective are you in prayer? Your level in prayer will determine your outstanding.\r\nPrayer will cause your vision to soar higher to the place where success is. Prayer is the only way to present and receive answers to your request.\r\nPsalms 50:15\r\n15. And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me\r\nJames 5:16\r\n16. Confess your fault one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of the righteous man availeth much.\r\nPower of Praise\r\nThe praises of believers are like incense that rise to God always. It is one of the easiest ways to enjoy the full support of God. Don\'t forget that your vision is one of your life wires that will lead you to greatness, don\'t play with it.\r\nAlso, it takes a person to have a vision and majority to interpret the vision with you. I pray for you, the right people that will help you to interpret your vision rightly will locate you in Jesus precious name. Your vision will not die!', '', '', '', '', '', 'ziggyadex@gmail.com', '2023-06-02', '');

It is worth knowing that the \"Promised Land\" is real, but to get there, there are battles to be fought and won.\r\n\r\nIt is a baby Christian that will tell you success can be achieved without facing its inevitable challenges. The dream Joseph had was great and wonderful, but what he went through before becoming a success, was beyond his capability and comprehension. Even our Lord Jesus, whose birth was prophesied right from the Old Testament to the New Testament, went through terrible anguish before He became fulfilled and victorious.\r\n\r\nGod will only tell you or reveal to you what you will in future, but He will not tell you what you will pass through before getting there.\r\n\r\nBusiness planning is good and easy, but to achieve the ultimate goal is not a day\'s job. Many quit business because of enormous challenges encountered. But such quitters cannot Whoever that follows his dream to the end despite all odds, will surely have a great testimony to share.\r\n\r\nChallenges are biblical and not caused by sin as most people think. It\'s expected of all followers of Christ to experience these before getting to their fulfillment.', 'No part of this publication may be reproduced or transmitted in any form or by any means, electronic or mechanical, audio or video recording or any information storage and retrieval system without the written permission of the author\r\n\r\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\r\n\r\nAll scriptural quotations are from the authorised King James Version of the Holy Bible\r\n\r\n& Published by: City of God Publishing House\r\n\r\n1, City of God Avenue, Off Adewunmi Adeleye Street,\r\n\r\nSilva Estate, Mafon Idimu, Lagos Tel: 08037174686, email: city4books@gmail.com\r\n\r\nISBN: 978-978-937-888-3\r\n\r\nFor further enquiries Please contact the author\r\n\r\nPastor T.

It could also mean a call to engage in a contest or fight or questioning an action and demanding an explanation. \"For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries. I Corinthians 16 vs.9\r\n\r\nThere are two types of challenges that face mankind. They are positive and negative challenges.\r\n\r\nPOSITIVE CHALLENGES: - Before you can be promoted to any level in life you must pass through some tests. Abraham went through God\'s test before God called him the father of many nations. God gave Isaac to him and his wife at an old age. The same God who gave him a child also demanded that the same child be sacrificed to Him. Nevertheless, he obeyed God.\r\n\r\n\"And it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.\r\n\r\nAnd he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. And Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.\r\nThen on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.\r\nAnd Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, come again to you,\r\nAnd Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together. Genesis 22:1-6\r\n\r\nThere was a time in the journey of my life that I needed to acquire an academic degree and I dreamed of achieving the goal. But before this could be possible, I was tested. It\'s not enough for anyone to conceive a dream, but to get prepared to pay the price that guarantees fulfillment. So before God will give you anything, He will test you and you must pass His test.\r\n\r\nNEGATIVE CHALLENGES:- The devil is always standing on the road of every successful people. When the brethren of Joseph realized the glorious future God had for the poor boy, they plotted to kill him.\r\n\r\n\"And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh. Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams. Genesis 37:19-20\r\n\r\nDavid is another example. He was a great asset to the entire Israel, but Satan possessed King Saul, who made attempts to kill him.\r\n\r\n\"And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.\r\n\r\nAnd Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul.\r\n\r\nTherefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.\r\n\r\nAnd David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him.1 Samuel 18:11-14. Satan is not ever happy about the good things that God has for His people. \"For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries 1 Corinthians 16:9 The moment you plan to succeed or achieve a particular goal, is the same time Satan and his agents will also start to map out strategies andvagenda to destroy the plan. I pray you will not be destroyed in Jesus Christ name. Amen\r\n\r\nWHAT IS A BUSINESS?\r\n\r\nA business is a specific commercial enterprise or establishment or a person\'s occupation, work or trade. Any legitimate activity you are doing that gives you a profit is called business. Our Lord Jesus confirms this in the book of Luke 2:49. \"And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father\'s business?\r\n\r\nWhen His parents were looking for Him, He told them He was occupied with His father\'s business.\r\n\r\nTYPES OF BUSINESS\r\n\r\nThere are also two types of business. One is spiritual and the other one is physical.\r\n\r\nSPIRITUAL BUSINESS: This is a God-given\r\n\r\nassignment to a class of people. This can also be referred to as a \'Gospel assignment\'. Whoever that is working in the vineyard of God is doing a God\'s business. In other words, such a person is engaging in a spiritual business.\r\n\r\n\"And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: Ephesians\r\n\r\n4:11-12\r\n\r\nGod gave these offices for the sake of the Gospel to empower people spiritually to yield profits to the His Kingdom and not for personal interest in any way. Jesus did His own assignment or business to promote the kingdom of God. It is also expected of you that are doing God\'s business to enhance profits to His Kingdom and not for your own selfish motives. \"But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. 1 Corinthians 12:7\r\n\r\nGod\'s business is not to be turned into a commercial engagement. How far have you gone in the God\'s business entrusted to you? Don\'t forget that the profit must go to the Kingdom of God and not a self- made kingdom. If you are not doing that, please correct your ways before it is too late.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL BUSINESS: This is a profit making engagement established by government, individual or a group of individuals. In this, you will find traders, artisans, professionals or salary earners engaging in one activity or the other. Whatever you are doing that earns you a profit, wage or salary is business.\r\n\r\nA business that is established by one person is called', 'WHY ARE THERE CHALLENGES?\r\n\r\nThere is no glory that is attained without challenges attached to it. Challenges are the ladder that catapults man to fulfillment. The level of your glory determines the level of challenges you will encounter in life. There\'s no one that is in pursuit of glory that will escape challenges. It is very unavoidable and even if you avoid it now, you will meet it in future. And there is no one that will not experience challenges before climbing the ladder of glory. As a matter of fact, you need to pass through challenges for certain reasons which I will like to explain as follows:\r\n\r\n1. To bring you closer to God: God told the people of Israel the reason why challenges must com their way. It made them to move closer to God n all their hearts. The nature of man is very funny at times. If pleasure gets to a certain level, man can easily forget God and do what pleases them. In order to move you closer to Him therefore, He allows challenges.\r\n\r\n2. To test your heart: Many are serving God with their mouth and not with their heart.\r\n\r\n\"And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments,. Deut. 8:2\r\n\r\nThere was a time someone needed a child from God. She was so determined and desperate that she made sure she attended all the programmmes in the church .But as soon as God answered her prayer, she stopped coming to the church. The pastor saw her somewhere one day and asked her why she has not been coming to church. And she said, what motivated her to be coming to church before has been settled and that what else would she be looking for again? Imagine the heart of man towards the plan of God. God uses challenges to test the heart of man.\r\n\r\n3. To humble you: Challenges are the surest way to humble man. A situation where someone is facing a challenge that is beyond his capacity, such a person\'s ego or pride will be deflated and he\'ll be forced to come down to the level of God.\r\n\r\n\"And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no Deut. 8:2\r\n\r\n4. To help you to trust God: \"Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. Proverbs 3:5-6\r\n\r\nThere was a time my wife was terribly sick to the point of death. I prayed and fasted for her healing but to no avail. At the end of the whole efforts I made that yielded no result, I resorted to putting my absolute trust in God that can do all things. To the glory of God, she got healed. A challenge will help you to trust God more and not depend on your own understanding.\r\n\r\n5.  To make you stronger: Due to the challenges that Apostle Paul went through, he declared he could do all things through Christ that strengthened him. A challenge builds the spiritual strength of people when it is received with joy. \"I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. Philippians 4:13\r\n\r\n6. To test your level of faith: Imagine the question Prophet Elisha asked that woman \'is it well with you\"? And she answered \'It is well\' even while her child was dead.\r\n\r\n\"And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died. And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out. And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again. And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him today? it is neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.\r\n\r\nThen she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee. So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that ShunammitÃ©: Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? Is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well. 2 Kings 4:20-26\r\n\r\nThe Shunammite woman in that Bible passage kept her dead son in the room and ran to the man of God. Mindless of her challenge, she built up her faith. What marvelous faith it was!\r\n\r\n7. To help you discover your potentials: The technology we are all enjoying today came through challenges. Due to increasing necessities, some people painstakingly faced the challenges and were forced to realize and used their potentials to invent things we enjoy today. If there had been no challenge, maybe we would not be where we are today. Thank God for people that took it upon themselves to rise up to the challenges to free mankind from all manner of challenging situations.\r\n\r\n8. To help you manage your resources: It is when a man is facing a challenge that he learns to manage the little he has. A challenge will help you to plan with the little resources at your disposal.\r\n\r\n\"For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also? Genesis 30:30\r\n\r\nIt is that your little that you manage well that will grow to a bigger level of glory in life.\r\n\r\nTo build your prayer life: A Challenge\r\n\r\n9. helps to build the spirit of prayer. Someone shared with me sometime ago that since he had been in the Lord, he had never prayed the way he is praying now. Challenges that overwhelmed him made hima praying man. As a Christian, if your challenge is getting out of hands, the next thing is to take the case to God in prayer. There is a prayer called \'prevailing prayer\'. It is challenges that would make someone to pray to that level. \r\n\r\n\"And Eli said to her, \"How long will keep on getting drunk? Get rid of your wine.\" \"Not so, my lord,\" Hannah replied, \"I am a woman who is deeply troubled. I have not been drinking wine or beer; pouring out my soul to the LORD. Do not take your servant for a wicked woman; I have been praying here out of my great anguish and grief.\" Eli answered, \"Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you what you have sked of him.\" She said, \"May your servant ind favor in your eyes.\" Then she went her way and ate something, and her face was no longer downcast. 1Samuel 1:14-18\r\n\r\n10. To develop your leadership qualities: Whoever that desires to lead must be a man or woman who has life experiences in terms of challenges. The challenge you are able to overcome will be a driving force that will make you a good leader people you are leading. It will also help you to master things in your field or career. Challenges are inevitable in life. Never see them as a problem but rather as a ladder to your glory.\r\n\r\nI pray that God will grant us all the power to overcome all our challenges in Jesus name. Amen. Expect challenges as they are part of life.', 'SOURCES OF CHALLENGES\r\n\r\n\"And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.\r\n\r\nCome now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams. And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him. And said unto them, Shed noblood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.\r\n\r\nAnd it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him:\r\n\r\nAnd they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it. And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt. Genesis 37:19-25\r\n\r\nYour challenges could come from anywhere. The first challenge of Joseph came from his brethren. It was his own biological brothers that stood against his progress. Remember it was one of the Disciplesof our Lord Jesus that Satan used to challenge Him. It could be someone you love most that Satan would use to stand against your way.\r\n\r\nThere was a time my elder brother wanted to join the Nigerian Police Force. During the recruitment exercise he counted himself lucky seeing one of our kinsmen as a member of the recruitment panel. My brother went to greet the man in our dialect, hoping this would motivate him to influence his chance. But he was wrong. On the contrary, the man used all his power to ensure my brother was not enlisted. What a challenge!\r\n\r\nDon\'t be surprised about it; anybody could be the source of your challenge. But leave everything to God to take charge. Never see anyone Satan is using to be the source of your challenge as your enemy; but give glory to God that allows it to happen.\r\n\r\n\"And when Joseph\'s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him. And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying, So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him. And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants.\r\nAnd Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?\r\nBut as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive. Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them. Genesis 50:15-21\r\n\r\nLook at the way Joseph handled the case of his brothers. They thought he would maltreat them for the evil they did to him. He viewed what his brothers did to him as a blessing in disguise and glorified God. He did not see them as an enemy, but as people God used to fulfill His plan for his life and to save the lives of his family. Don\'t look at that man or woman whom Satan makes the source of your challenge as an enemy, but an instrument of progress to your life. Despite what Simon Peter did to Jesus, denying Him openly, He still prayed for him.\r\n\r\n\"But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren. Luke 22:32\r\n\r\nIt was the prayer of Jesus that helped Simon Peter to stand firm in the Lord. You need to cultivate the', 'RESPONSE TO CHALLENGES\r\n\r\nOur reaction towards challenges matters a lot. The way some people react to a challenge makes it to overcome them. There are steps you need to consider before reacting to challenges. An adage says; be fast to hear but slow to respond. A wise man must not respond to a challenge anyhow.\r\n\r\nWith all what David went through in the palace of King Saul, he handled the case wisely. \"Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.1 Samuel\r\n\r\n18:15\r\n\r\nChallenges well-handled are challenges overcome. I pray your challenges will not overcome you and you\'ll sing a song of victory in Jesus name. Now, what are the steps to consider before reacting to challenges?\r\n\r\n1. PRAYER: This is a way of communicating with God or pouring out your desires to Him. The first weapon for all believers to use when a challenge comes his way is an effective prayer, which the Bible says availeth much.\r\n\r\n\"Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.\"James 5:16 When Simon Peter had a problem with King Herod, he was kept in prison. But other brethren began to pray seriously for him and to the glory of God; their prayers subsequently set him free from the prison of Herod.\r\n\r\n\"Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.\r\n\r\nAnd when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands. And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me. And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision. Acts: 12:5-9\r\n\r\nThere is no mountain that prayer cannot move. Whatever you are facing as a believer, tackle it with prayer and you will overcome and testify in Jesus name. Amen.\r\n\r\n2. WISDOM: Wisdom is the application of\r\n\r\nknowledge in a right way. It is one of the great weapons that deal with challenges. The Bible calls it the \"principal thing\" and something \"profitable to direct\".\r\n\r\n\"Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding. Proverbs 4:7\r\n\r\n\"If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct. Eccl. 10:10 David dealt with King Saul wisely. Despite all King Saul did to David, God gave him wisdom to handle the king. It was the wisdom that David employed in handling Saul that hindered Saul not to kill him. Handle your challenges with the wisdom of God.\r\n\r\n-Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of\r\n\r\nhim 1Samuel 18:15\r\n\r\nImagine the way a whole nation\'s king was being handled wisely. So you need the wisdom of God to handle your case.\r\n\r\n3- FULL KNOWLEDGE: Half knowledge is not enough to combat challenges. Get detailed knowledge about the challenges you are passing through. It was Daniel\'s adequate knowledge that helped him to open the understanding of his people.\r\n\r\n\"In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem. Daniel 9:2 Even the Bible says people are perishing for lack of knowledge. Whoever that lacks adequate information about the challenges facing him will not get a way out. Whatever challenges that come your way, make sure you have a full knowledge of it before confronting it. Knowledge is good.\r\n\r\n4. CLEAR UNDERSTANDING: Some challenges come up through an enemy\'s jealousy of progress or success; while some come naturally to enhance your promotion in life. If you are facing any challenge, the first thing to do is to have a full understanding of it before taking any step.\r\n\r\n\"Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding. Proverbs 4:7. It is one thing to have knowledge; it\'s another thing to have a clear understanding. So get a clear understanding.\r\n\r\n5. DON\'T BE PRE-OCCUPIED BY YOUR CHALLENGE: Many allow their challenges to overwhelm them as their daily routine, thereby ignoring their normal activities for the day. Anyone that wants to overcome a challenge must not dwell or focus on it for any reason. See it as an ephemeral case that comes and will definitely go in due time. Some pamper their challenges with continuous brooding and weeping. But such steps cannot take away challenges. Whoever that knows how to ignore Satan will know how to easily overcome him. Use your action to get rid of your problems and stop entertaining your challenges.\r\n\r\n\"Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well. 2 Kings 4:26\r\n\r\nJust consider the case of that woman that lost her son and ran to Prophet Elisha for a solution. The Prophet asked her if it was well with her and the woman said, \'it is well\'. What great faith she had! Many cannot act the way the Shunmanite woman acted. Don\'t turn your challenges to something to worry about.\r\n\r\n6. WALK WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE: In times of challenges, there are some people you need to move with while there are some you dare not associate yourself with at all. 1 Corinthians 15:33 \"Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners\". Moving with the wrong people during your challenging period will invariably add more problems to your life. But connecting yourself with the right people will help you overcome your challenges. Right people will relatively give you rest and useful advice that may provide an ultimate solution to your problem in times of challenges. Check the people you are walking with right now. Are they right or wrong people?', 'BENEFITS OF CHALLENGES\r\n\r\nEveryone that sits for an examination and answers the questions correctly will achieve his desire or get promoted to a higher level. After series of challenges in life, what follows is a blessing from the above. Every solider that undergoes a military training is equipped with knowledge of war strategies that will be the bedrock of his promotion in his career. The following are the benefits that come after challenges. \r\n\r\n1. CLOSENESS TO GOD: Challenges a of the best tools to draw man closer to God. What are one man think is impossible is absolutely possible when taken to God \"But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, with men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible. Matthew 19:26\r\n\r\nMany children of God had preached the Gospel to my father in different ways, but he turned a deaf ear to them. It was a sickness that almost claimed his life that led him to God for healing and made him surrender his life to Jesus. If you ask people in the church today what led them to God, ninety percent will challenges. Challenges make someone to move closer to God, even more than ever before.\r\n\r\n2. A STRONGER PERSON: The challenge David had with the bear and lion in the wilderness, in which he killed both wild animals made him stronger. No wonder he was able to confront Goliath. He told King Saul that his experience in the wilderness was what gave him the confidence to challenge Goliath. A challenge that is successfully overcome makes one to become stronger. Caleb said he was eighty years of age but as strong as a man of forty years. Despite your age, if you overcome a challenge, it will make you stronger.\r\n\r\n3. A WISER PERSON: People of Israel saw that David dealt wisely with King Saul and for that reason; he was wiser than the king of a whole nation. Of course, the trap you escaped from cannot catch you again, as you are now wiser\r\n\r\n4. PROMOTION: When God does that thing you are trusting in Him to do in your life, it simply means you have been lifted above that particular situation and God has promoted you. \"Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name...Philippians 2:9\r\n\r\nWhen our Lord Jesus won the victory on the Cross of Calvary, He was highly elevated both in heaven and on earth. Don\'t run away from that challenge; can assure you that you will soon overcome it and receive your promotion. Our Lord Jesus did not run away from His own challenge. Face yours and receive your crown.\r\n\r\nA SHINING STAR: After the trial of Christ\r\n\r\n5. in the wilderness, His fame spread throughout the whole regions around. \"And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the regions round about. Luke 4:14\r\n\r\nWhen David defeated Goliath, his star shone throughout the land of Israel that even women sang a song to praise him. \"And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.1 Samuel 18:7\r\n\r\nVictory after a challenge will make your star to shine and people will celebrate you. David was too young in comparison to King Saul; but what God did through him made him a shining star that he was rated even above the king. Don\'t allow your challenges to defeat you; but defeat your challenges for a better tomorrow.\r\n\r\n6. TEACHER: Overcoming challenges will\r\n\r\nmake you a great teacher to your generation. Experience, they say, is the best teacher. People will like to know how you scaled the hurdles and succeeded in the race. Many would imagine how you easily succeeded in what they had tried and failed. When God told me to start a church; I started in my sitting room and before you know what was happening, the whole place was filled up with people and from there the church grew and moved to a better place. And people began to ask me how I did it. Afterwards, I took up the task of teaching people how to succeed. A lot happened on the way, but I succeeded all the same to the glory of God. You will succeed in Jesus name. Amen\r\n\r\n7. TESTIMONY: Whoever that overcomes a challenge will surely have a testimony to share. There was a time enemies told a woman that she would not have any issue in life. After many years of challenges, God answered her prayer at the age of 52 and she had a baby girl. woman testified to the glory of God, while Satan and his agents were put to shame. I pray for you reader, you will testify over the challenge you are facing right now and your enemy or those mocking you at the moment will witness your testimony in Jesus name. Amen\r\n\r\n8. GOD WILL TAKE GLORY: The name of God will be glorified in the life of anyone that overcomes his challenges. The name of God was glorified in the life of Joseph. His brethren thought they did evil to him, but God turned it to a glorious end. All glory was given to God and shame went back to Satan. \"And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?', '', '', '', '', '', 'ziggyadex@gmail.com', '2023-06-02', '');
